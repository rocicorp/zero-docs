title: Reading Data with ZQL
---

ZQL is Zero’s query language.

Inspired by SQL, ZQL is expressed in TypeScript with heavy use of the builder pattern. If you have used [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) or [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/), ZQL will feel familiar.

ZQL queries are composed of one or more _clauses_ that are chained together into a _query_.

Unlike queries in classic databases, the result of a ZQL query is a _view_ that updates automatically and efficiently as the underlying data changes. You can call a query’s `materialize()` method to get a view, but more typically you run queries via some framework-specific bindings. For example see `useQuery` for [React](react) or [SolidJS](solidjs).

<Note type="note" emoji="🧑‍🏫" slug="immutability" heading="Data returned from ZQL should be considered immutable">
This means you should not modify the data directly. Instead, clone the data and modify the clone.

ZQL caches values and returns them multiple times. If you modify a value returned from ZQL, you will modify it everywhere it is used. This can lead to subtle bugs.

JavaScript and TypeScript lack true immutable types so we use `readonly` to help enforce it. But it's easy to cast away the `readonly` accidentally.

In the future, we'll [`freeze`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) all returned data in `dev` mode to help prevent this.

</Note>

## Select

ZQL queries start by selecting a table. There is no way to select a subset of columns; ZQL queries always return the entire row, if permissions allow it.

```tsx
const z = new Zero(...);

// Returns a query that selects all rows and columns from the issue table.
z.query.issue;
```

This is a design tradeoff that allows Zero to better reuse the row locally for future queries. This also makes it easier to share types between different parts of the code.

## Ordering

You can sort query results by adding an `orderBy` clause:

```tsx
z.query.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc');
```

Multiple `orderBy` clauses can be present, in which case the data is sorted by those clauses in order:

```tsx
// Order by priority descending. For any rows with same priority,
// then order by created desc.
z.query.issue.orderBy('priority', 'desc').orderBy('created', 'desc');
```

All queries in ZQL have a default final order of their primary key. Assuming the `issue` table has a primary key on the `id` column, then:

```tsx
// Actually means: z.query.issue.orderBy('id', 'asc');
z.query.issue;

// Actually means: z.query.issue.orderBy('priority', 'desc').orderBy('id', 'asc');
z.query.issue.orderBy('priority', 'desc');
```

## Limit

You can limit the number of rows to return with `limit()`:

```tsx
z.query.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(100);
```

## Paging

You can start the results at or after a particular row with `start()`:

```tsx
let start: IssueRow | undefined;
while (true) {
  let q = z.query.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(100);
  if (start) {
    q = q.start(start);
  }
  const batch = await q.run();
  console.log('got batch', batch);

  if (batch.length < 100) {
    break;
  }
  start = batch[batch.length - 1];
}
```

By default `start()` is _exclusive_ - it returns rows starting **after** the supplied reference row. This is what you usually want for paging. If you want _inclusive_ results, you can do:

```tsx
z.query.issue.start(row, {inclusive: true});
```

## Getting a Single Result

If you want exactly zero or one results, use the `one()` clause. This causes ZQL to return `Row|undefined` rather than `Row[]`.

```tsx
const result = await z.query.issue.where('id', 42).one().run();
if (!result) {
  console.error('not found');
}
```

`one()` overrides any `limit()` clause that is also present.

## Relationships

You can query related rows using _relationships_ that are defined in your [Zero schema](/docs/zero-schema).

```tsx
// Get all issues and their related comments
z.query.issue.related('comments');
```

Relationships are returned as hierarchical data. In the above example, each row will have a `comments` field, which is an array of the corresponding comments rows.

You can fetch multiple relationships in a single query:

```tsx
z.query.issue.related('comments').related('reactions').related('assignees');
```

### Refining Relationships

By default all matching relationship rows are returned, but this can be refined. The `related` method accepts an optional second function which is itself a query.

```tsx
z.query.issue.related(
  'comments',
  // It is common to use the 'q' shorthand variable for this parameter,
  // but it is a _comment_ query in particular here, exactly as if you
  // had done z.query.comment.
  q => q.orderBy('modified', 'desc').limit(100).start(lastSeenComment),
);
```

This _relationship query_ can have all the same clauses that top-level queries can have.

<Note type="warning" heading="Order and limit not supported in junction relationships">
Using `orderBy` or `limit` in a relationship that goes through a junction table (i.e., a many-to-many relationship) is not currently supported and will throw a runtime error. See [bug 3527](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3527).

You can sometimes work around this by making the junction relationship explicit, depending on your schema and usage.

</Note>

### Nested Relationships

You can nest relationships arbitrarily:

```tsx
// Get all issues, first 100 comments for each (ordered by modified,desc),
// and for each comment all of its reactions.
z.query.issue.related('comments', q =>
  q.orderBy('modified', 'desc').limit(100).related('reactions'),
);
```

## Where

You can filter a query with `where()`:

```tsx
z.query.issue.where('priority', '=', 'high');
```

The first parameter is always a column name from the table being queried. TypeScript completion will offer available options (sourced from your [Zero Schema](/docs/zero-schema)).

### Comparison Operators

Where supports the following comparison operators:

| Operator                                 | Allowed Operand Types         | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `=` , `!=`                               | boolean, number, string       | JS strict equal (===) semantics                                          |
| `<` , `<=`, `>`, `>=`                    | number                        | JS number compare semantics                                              |
| `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`, `ILIKE`, `NOT ILIKE` | string                        | SQL-compatible `LIKE` / `ILIKE`                                          |
| `IN` , `NOT IN`                          | boolean, number, string       | RHS must be array. Returns true if rhs contains lhs by JS strict equals. |
| `IS` , `IS NOT`                          | boolean, number, string, null | Same as `=` but also works for `null`                                    |

TypeScript will restrict you from using operators with types that don’t make sense – you can’t use `>` with `boolean` for example.

<Note type="note" slug="adding-operators">
  If you don’t see the comparison operator you need, let us know, many are easy
  to add.
</Note>

### Equals is the Default Comparison Operator

Because comparing by `=` is so common, you can leave it out and `where` defaults to `=`.

```tsx
z.query.issue.where('priority', 'high');
```

### Comparing to `null`

As in SQL, ZQL’s `null` is not equal to itself (`null ≠ null`).

This is required to make join semantics work: if you’re joining `employee.orgID` on `org.id` you do **not** want an employee in no organization to match an org that hasn’t yet been assigned an ID.

When you purposely want to compare to `null` ZQL supports `IS` and `IS NOT` operators that work just like in SQL:

```tsx
// Find employees not in any org.
z.query.employee.where('orgID', 'IS', null);
```

TypeScript will prevent you from comparing to `null` with other operators.

### Compound Filters

The argument to `where` can also be a callback that returns a complex expression:

```tsx
// Get all issues that have priority 'critical' or else have both
// priority 'medium' and not more than 100 votes.
z.query.issue.where(({cmp, and, or, not}) =>
  or(
    cmp('priority', 'critical'),
    and(cmp('priority', 'medium'), not(cmp('numVotes', '>', 100))),
  ),
);
```

`cmp` is short for _compare_ and works the same as `where` at the top-level except that it can’t be chained and it only accepts comparison operators (no relationship filters – see below).

Note that chaining `where()` is also a one-level `and`:

```tsx
// Find issues with priority 3 or higher, owned by aa
z.query.issue.where('priority', '>=', 3).where('owner', 'aa');
```

### Comparing Literal Values

The `where` clause always expects its first parameter to be a column name as a string. Same with the `cmp` helper:

```ts
// "foo" is a column name, not a string:
z.query.issue.where('foo', 'bar');

// "foo" is a column name, not a string:
z.query.issue.where(({cmp}) => cmp('foo', 'bar'));
```

To compareto a literal value, use the `cmpLit` helper:

```ts
z.query.issue.where(cmpLit('foobar', 'foo' + 'bar'));
```

By itself this is not very useful, but the first parameter can also be a JavaScript variable:

```ts
z.query.issue.where(cmpLit(role, 'admin'));
```

Or, within a [permission rule](/docs/permissions#permissions-based-on-auth-data), you can compare to a field of the `authData` parameter:

```ts
z.query.issue.where(cmpLit(authData.role, 'admin'));
```

### Relationship Filters

Your filter can also test properties of relationships. Currently the only supported test is existence:

```tsx
// Find all orgs that have at least one employee
z.query.organization.whereExists('employees');
```

The argument to `whereExists` is a relationship, so just like other relationships, it can be refined with a query:

```tsx
// Find all orgs that have at least one cool employee
z.query.organization.whereExists('employees', q =>
  q.where('location', 'Hawaii'),
);
```

As with querying relationships, relationship filters can be arbitrarily nested:

```tsx
// Get all issues that have comments that have reactions
z.query.issue.whereExists('comments',
	q => q.whereExists('reactions'));
);
```

The `exists` helper is also provided which can be used with `and`, `or`, `cmp`, and `not` to build compound filters that check relationship existence:

```tsx
// Find issues that have at least one comment or are high priority
z.query.issue.where({cmp, or, exists} =>
  or(
    cmp('priority', 'high'),
    exists('comments'),
  ),
);
```

## Data Lifetime and Reuse

Zero reuses data synced from prior queries to answer new queries when possible. This is what enables instant UI transitions.

But what controls the lifetime of this client-side data? How can you know whether any particular query will return instant results? How can you know whether those results will be up to date or stale?

The answer is that the data on the client is simply the union of rows returned from queries which are currently syncing. Once a row is no longer returned by any syncing query, it is removed from the client. Thus, there is never any stale data in Zero.

So when you are thinking about whether a query is going to return results instantly, you should think about _what other queries are syncing_, not about what data is local. Data exists locally if and only if there is a query syncing that returns that data.

<Note type="note" heading="Caches vs Replicas">
  This is why we often say that despite the name `zero-cache`, Zero is not technically a cache. It's a *replica*.

A cache has a random set of rows with a random set of versions. There is no expectation that the cache has any particular rows, or that the rows have matching versions. Rows are simply updated as they are fetched.

A replica, by contrast, is eagerly updated whether or not any client has requested a row. A replica is always very close to up-to-date, and always self-consistent.

Zero is a _partial_ replica because it only replicates rows that are returned by syncing queries.

</Note>

## Query Lifecycle

<ImageLightbox
  src="/images/reading-data/query-lifecycle.png"
  caption="The lifecycle of a ZQL query."
/>

Queries can be either _active_ or _backgrounded_. An active query is one that is currently being used by the application. Backgrounded queries are not currently in use, but continue syncing in case they are needed again soon.

Active queries are created one of three ways:

1. The app calls `q.materialize()` to get a `View`.
2. The app uses a platform binding like React's `useQuery(q)`.
3. The app calls [`preload()`](#preloading) to sync larger queries without a view.

Active queries sync until they are _deactivated_. The way this happens depends on how the query was created:

1. For `materialize()` queries, the UI calls `destroy()` on the view.
2. For `useQuery()`, the UI unmounts the component (which calls `destroy()` under the covers).
3. For `preload()`, the UI calls `cleanup()` on the return value of `preload()`.

### Background Queries

By default a deactivated query stops syncing immediately.

But it's often useful to keep queries syncing beyond deactivation in case the UI needs the same or a similar query in the near future. This is accomplished with the `ttl` parameter:

```ts
const [user] = useQuery(z.query.user.where('id', userId), {ttl: '1d'});
```

The `ttl` parameter specifies how long the app developer wishes the query to run in the background. The following formats are allowed (where `%d` is a positive integer):

| Format    | Meaning                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none`    | No backgrounding. Query will immediately stop when deactivated. This is the default. |
| `%ds`     | Number of seconds.                                                                   |
| `%dm`     | Number of minutes.                                                                   |
| `%dh`     | Number of hours.                                                                     |
| `%dd`     | Number of days.                                                                      |

<Note type="warning" slug="long-ttl-warning" heading="Long TTLs are deprecated">
Zero currently also accepts `ttl` values of `forever` and `%dy` (number of years). These are not recommended and will be removed in the next release. They were a misfeature.

We realized long `ttl` values can lead to a lot of queries running in the background unnecessarily. If a new app release is deployed with new queries, the old queries keep running until their `ttl` expires, even though the app will never use them.

We will be reworking this API to be less of a footgun in the next Zero release. For now we do not recommend using a `ttl` greater than `1d`.
</Note>

If the UI re-requests a background query, it becomes an active query again. Since the query was syncing in the background, the very first synchronous result that the UI receives after reactivation will be up-to-date with the server (i.e., it will have `resultType` of `complete`).

Just like other types of queries, the data from background queries is available for use by new queries. A common pattern is to [preload](#preloading) a subset of most commonly needed data with `{ttl: 'forever'}` and then do more specific queries from the UI with e.g. `{ttl: '1d'}`. Most often the preloaded data will be able to answer user queries, but if not, the new query will be answered by the server and backgrounded for a day in case the user revisits it.

### Client Capacity Management

Zero has a default soft limit of 20,000 rows on the client-side, or about 20MB of data assuming 1KB rows.

This limit can be increased with the [`--target-client-row-count`](./zero-cache-config#target-client-row-count) flag, but we do not recommend setting it higher than 100,000.

<Note slug="client-capacity" heading="Why does Zero store so little data client-side?">
Contrary to the design of other sync engines, we believe that storing tons of data client-side doesn't make sense. Here are some reasons why:

- Initial sync will be slow, slowing down initial app load.
- Because storage in browser tabs is unreliable, initial sync can occur surprisingly often.
- We want to answer queries _instantly_ as often as possible. This requires client-side data in memory on the main thread. If we have to page to disk, we may as well go to the network and reduce complexity.
- Even though Zero's queries are very efficient, they do still have some cost, especially hydration. Massive client-side storage would result in hydrating tons of queries that are unlikely to be used every time the app starts.

Most importantly, no matter how much data you store on the client, there will be cases where you have to fallback to the server:

- Some users might have huge amounts of data.
- Some users might have tiny amounts of available client storage.
- You will likely want the app to start fast and sync in the background.

Because you have to be able to fallback to server the question becomes _what is the **right** amount of data to store on the client?_, not _how can I store the absolute max possible data on the client?_

The goal with Zero is to answer 99% of queries on the client from memory. The remaining 1% of queries can fallback gracefully to the server. 20,000 rows was chosen somewhat arbitrarily as a number of rows that was likely to be able to do this for many applications.

There is no hard limit at 20,000 or 100,000. Nothing terrible happens if you go above. The thing to keep in mind is that:

1. All those queries will revalidate every time your app boots.
2. All data synced to the client is in memory in JS.

</Note>

Here is how this limit is managed:

1. Active queries are never destroyed, even if the limit is exceeded. Developers are expected to keep active queries well under the limit.
2. The `ttl` value counts from the moment a query deactivates. Backgrounded queries are destroyed immediately when the `ttl` is reached, even if the limit hasn't been reached.
3. If the client exceeds its limit, Zero will destroy backgrounded queries, least-recently-used first, until the store is under the limit again.

### Thinking in Queries

Although IVM is a very efficient way to keep queries up to date relative to re-running them, it isn't free. You still need to think about how many queries you are creating, how long they are kept alive, and how expensive they are.

This is why Zero defaults to _not_ backgrounding queries and doesn't try to aggressively fill its client datastore to capacity. You should put some thought into what queries you want to run in the background, and for how long.

Zero currently provides a few basic tools to understand the cost of your queries:

- The client logs a warning for slow query materializations. Look for `Slow query materialization` in your logs. The default threshold is `5s` (including network) but this is configurable with the `slowMaterializeThreshold` parameter.
- The client logs the materialization time of all queries at the `debug` level. Look for `Materialized query` in your logs.
- The server logs a warning for slow query materializations. Look for `Slow query materialization` in your logs. The default threshold is `5s` but this is configurable with the `log-slow-materialize-threshold` configuration parameter.

We will be adding more tools over time.

## Completeness

Zero immediately returns the data for a query it has on the client, then falls back to the server for any missing data. Sometimes it's useful to know the difference between these two types of results. To do so, use the `result` from `useQuery`:

```tsx
const [issues, issuesResult] = useQuery(z.query.issue);
if (issuesResult.type === 'complete') {
  console.log('All data is present');
} else {
  console.log('Some data is missing');
}
```

The possible values of `result.type` are currently `complete` and `unknown`.

The `complete` value is currently only returned when Zero has received the server result. But in the future, Zero will be able to return this result type when it _knows_ that all possible data for this query is already available locally. Additionally, we plan to add a `prefix` result for when the data is known to be a prefix of the complete result. See [Consistency](#consistency) for more information.

## Handling Missing Data

It is inevitable that there will be cases where the requested data cannot be found. Because Zero returns local results immediately, and server results asynchronously, displaying "not found" / 404 UI can be slightly tricky. If you just use a simple existence check, you will often see the 404 UI flicker while the server result loads:

```tsx
const [issue, issuesResult] = useQuery(
  z.query.issue.where('id', 'some-id').one(),
);

// ❌ This causes flickering of the UI
if (!issue) {
  return <div>404 Not Found</div>;
} else {
  return <div>{issue}</div>;
}
```

The way to do this correctly is to only display the "not found" UI when the result type is `complete`. This way the 404 page is slow but pages with data are still just as fast.

```tsx
const [issue, issuesResult] = useQuery(
  z.query.issue.where('id', 'some-id').one(),
);

if (!issue && issueResult.type === 'complete') {
  return <div>404 Not Found</div>;
}

if (!issue) {
  return null;
}

return <div>{issue}</div>;
```

## Listening to Changes

Currently, the way to listen for changes in query results is not ideal. You can add a listener to a materialized view which has the new data and result as parameters:

```ts
z.query.issue.materialize().addListener((issues, issuesResult) => {
  // do stuff...
});
```

However, using this method will maintain its own materialized view in memory which is wasteful. It also doesn't allow for granular listening to events like `add` and `remove` of rows.

A better way would be to create your own view without actually storing the data which will also allow you to listen to specific events. Again, the API is not good and will be improved in the future.

```ts
// Inside the View class
// Instead of storing the change, we invoke some callback
push(change: Change): void {
  switch (change.type) {
    case 'add':
      this.#onAdd?.(change)
      break
    case 'remove':
      this.#onRemove?.(change)
      break
    case 'edit':
      this.#onEdit?.(change)
      break
    case 'child':
      this.#onChild?.(change)
      break
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown change type: ${change['type']}`)
  }
}
```

(see View implementations in [`zero-vue`](https://github.com/danielroe/zero-vue/blob/f25808d4b7d1ef0b8e01a5670d7e3050d6a64bbf/src/view.ts#L77-L89) or [`zero-solid`](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/51995101d0657519207f1c4695a8765b9016e07c/packages/zero-solid/src/solid-view.ts#L119-L131))

## Preloading

Almost all Zero apps will want to preload some data in order to maximize the feel of instantaneous UI transitions.

In Zero, preloading is done via queries – the same queries you use in the UI and for auth.

However, because preload queries are usually much larger than a screenful of UI, Zero provides a special `preload()` helper to avoid the overhead of materializing the result into JS objects:

```tsx
// Preload the first 1k issues + their creator, assignee, labels, and
// the view state for the active user.
//
// There's no need to render this data, so we don't use `useQuery()`:
// this avoids the overhead of pulling all this data into JS objects.
z.query.issue
  .related('creator')
  .related('assignee')
  .related('labels')
  .related('viewState', q => q.where('userID', z.userID).one())
  .orderBy('created', 'desc')
  .limit(1000)
  .preload();
```

## Running Queries Once

You usually want to subscribe to a query in a reactive UI, but every so often you'll need to run a query just once. To do this, use the `run()` method:

```tsx
const results = await z.query.issue.where('foo', 'bar').run();
```

By default, `run()` only returns results that are currently available on the client. That is, it returns the data that would be given for [`result.type === 'unknown'`](#completeness).

If you want to wait for the server to return results, pass `{type: 'complete'}` to `run`:

```tsx
const results = await z.query.issue.where('foo', 'bar').run({type: 'complete'});
```

<Note slug="default-run">
As a convenience you can also directly await queries:

```ts
await z.query.issue.where('foo', 'bar');
```

This is the same as saying `run()` or `run({type: 'unknown'})`.

</Note>

## Consistency

Zero always syncs a consistent partial replica of the backend database to the client. This avoids many common consistency issues that come up in classic web applications. But there are still some consistency issues to be aware of when using Zero.

For example, imagine that you have a bug database w/ 10k issues. You preload the first 1k issues sorted by created.

The user then does a query of issues assigned to themselves, sorted by created. Among the 1k issues that were preloaded imagine 100 are found that match the query. Since the data we preloaded is in the same order as this query, we are guaranteed that any local results found will be a _prefix_ of the server results.

The UX that result is nice: the user will see initial results to the query instantly. If more results are found server-side, those results are guaranteed to sort below the local results. There's no shuffling of results when the server response comes in.

Now imagine that the user switches the sort to ‘sort by modified’. This new query will run locally, and will again find some local matches. But it is now unlikely that the local results found are a prefix of the server results. When the server result comes in, the user will probably see the results shuffle around.

To avoid this annoying effect, what you should do in this example is also preload the first 1k issues sorted by modified desc. In general for any query shape you intend to do, you should preload the first `n` results for that query shape with no filters, in each sort you intend to use.

<Note slug="no-duplicate-rows" heading="Zero does not sync duplicate rows">
Zero syncs the *union* of all active queries' results. You don't have to worry about syncing many sorts of the same query when it's likely the results will overlap heavily.

</Note>

In the future, we will be implementing a consistency model that fixes these issues automatically. We will prevent Zero from returning local data when that data is not known to be a prefix of the server result. Once the consistency model is implemented, preloading can be thought of as purely a performance thing, and not required to avoid unsightly flickering.
