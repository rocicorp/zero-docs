title: Zero 0.19
description: Many, many bugfixes and cleanups
---

## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.19
```

## Upgrading

- If you use custom mutators, please see [hello-zero-solid](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/pull/18/files) for how to update your push endpoint.
- If you use SolidJS, please switch to [`createQuery`](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/pull/18/files).
- If you are `awaiting z.mutate.foo.bar()`, you should [switch to `await z.mutate.foo.bar().client`](/docs/writing-data#waiting-for-mutator-result) to be consistent with `.server`.
- If you were using a 0.19 canary, the `.server` property [returns error by rejection again](/docs/writing-data#waiting-for-mutator-result) (like 0.18 did). Sorry about the thrash here.

## Features

- Add a `type` param to `query.run()` so it can wait for server results ([doc](/docs/reading-data#running-queries-once), [bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3243))
- `await z.mutate.foo.bar()` is now `await z.mutate.foo.bar().client` for consistency with `.server`, old API still works but deprecated ([doc](/docs/writing-data#waiting-for-mutator-result))
- Improve speed of litestream restore by about 7x
- Increase replication speed when using JSON by about 25%
- Add options to `analyze-query` to apply permissions and auth data ([doc](/docs/debug/permissions#read-permissions)).
- Add option to `--lazy-startup` to `zero-cache` to delay connecting to upstram until first connection ([doc](/docs/zero-cache-config#lazy-startup))
- Add `/statz` endpoint for getting some health statistics from a running Zero instance ([doc](/docs/debug/slow-queries#statz))

## Fixes

- Support passing `Request` to `PushProccesor.process()` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4214))
- Fix layering in `PushProcessor` to better support custom db implementations (thanks Erik Munson!) ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4251))
- Fix socket disconnects in GCP ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4173))
- Quote Postgres enum types to preserve casing ([report](https://discord.com/channels/830183651022471199/1358217995188437074/1358218))
- `z2s`: Return `undefined` for empty result set when using `query.one()`
- `z2s`: Allow accessing tables in non-public schemas
- `z2s`: Allow `tx.foo.update({bar: undefined})` where `bar` is `optional` to match client behavior
- Fix broken replication when updating a key that is part of a unique (but non-PK) index
- `solid`: Rename `useQuery` to `createQuery` to fit Solid naming conventions (old name deprecated)
- Resync when publications are missing ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4205))
- Fix missing `NOT LIKE` in `query.where()` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4217))
- Fix timezone shift when writing to `timestamp`/`timestamptz` and server is non-UTC timezone (thanks Tom Jenkinson!) ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4216))
- Bound time spent in incremental updates to 1/2 hydration time
- Fix `ttl` being off by 1000 in some cases ðŸ˜¬ ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4225))
- `z2s`: Relationships nested in a junction relationship were not working correctly ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4221))
- Custom mutators: Due to multitab, client can receive multiple responses for same mutation
- Fix deadlock that could happen when pushing on a closed websocket ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4256))
- Fix incorrect shutdown under heavy CPU load (thanks Erik Munson!) ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4252))
- Fix case where deletes were getting reverted (thanks for reproduction Marc MacLeod!) ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4282))
- `z2s`: Incorrect handling of self-join, and not exists
- `not(exists())` is not supported on the client
- re-auth on 401s returned by push endpoint
- Added `push.queryParams` constructor parameter to allow passing query params to the push endpoint ([doc](/docs/writing-data#setting-up-the-server))

## Breaking Changes

- The structure of setting up a `PushProcesor` has changed slightly. See [push endpoint setup](/docs/writing-data#setting-up-the-server) or [upgrade guide](#upgrading).
- Not technically a breaking change from 0.18, but if you were using 0.19 canaries, the `.server` property returns error by rejection again (like 0.18 did) ([doc](/docs/writing-data#waiting-for-mutator-result)).
