title: Connecting to Postgres
---

In the future, Zero will work with many different backend databases. Today only Postgres is supported. Specifically, Zero requires Postgres v15.0 or higher, and support for [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

Here are some common Postgres options and what we know about their support level:

| Postgres                          | Support Status                                                                                              |

| AWS RDS                           | ‚úÖ                                                                                                          |
| AWS Aurora                        | ‚úÖ v15.6+                                                                                                   |
| Google Cloud SQL                  | ‚úÖ See [notes below](#google-cloud-sql)                                                                     |
| [Fly.io](http://Fly.io) Postgres  | ‚úÖ                                                                                                          |
| Supabase, Neon, Render, Heroku    | ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†Partial support with autoreset. See [Schema Changes](#schema-changes) and provider-specific notes below. |

## Schema Changes

Zero uses Postgres ‚Äú[Event Triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createeventtrigger.html)‚Äù when possible to implement high-quality, efficient [schema migration](zero-schema/#migrations).

Some hosted Postgres providers don‚Äôt provide access to Event Triggers.

Zero still works out of the box with these providers, but for correctness, any schema change triggers a full reset of all server-side and client-side state. For small databases (< 1GB) this can be OK, but for bigger databases we recommend choosing a provider that grants access to Event Triggers.

## Configuration

The Postgres `wal_level` config parameter has to be set to `logical`. You can check what level your pg has with this command:

```bash
psql -c 'SHOW wal_level'
```

If it doesn‚Äôt output `logical` then you need to change the wal level. To do this, run:

```bash
psql -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'logical';"
```

Then restart Postgres. On most pg systems you can do this like so:

```bash
data_dir=$(psql -t -A -c 'SHOW data_directory')
pg_ctl -D "$data_dir" restart
```

After your server restarts, show the `wal_level` again to ensure it has changed:

```bash
psql -c 'SHOW wal_level'
```

## SSL Mode

Some Postgres providers (notably Fly.io, so far) do not support TLS on their internal networks. You can disable
attempting to use it by adding the `sslmode=disable` query parameter to your connection strings from `zero-cache`.

## Provider-Specific Notes

### Google Cloud SQL

To use Google Cloud SQL you must [manually create a `PUBLICATION`](/docs/postgres-support#limiting-replication)
and specify that publication name in the [App Publications](/docs/zero-cache-config#app-publications)
option when running `zero-cache`.

(Google Cloud SQL does not provide sufficient permissions for `zero-cache` to create its default publication.)

### Supabase

In order to connect to Supabase you must use the "Direct Connection" style connection string, not the pooler:

<ImageLightbox
  src="/images/connecting-to-postgres/direct.png"
  alt="Screenshot of UI to get correct connection string"
/>

This is because Zero sets up a logical replication slot, which is only supported with a direct connection.

Additionally, you'll likely need to assign a IPv4 address to your Supabase instance. This is not supported on the free Supabase tier, and is an extra $4/mo fee.
