title: Debugging Permissions
---

Given that permissions are defined in their own file and internally applied to queries, it might be hard to figure out if or why a permission check is failing.

## Read Permissions

The `transform-query` utility is provided to transform a query by applying permissions to it. As of today you'll need to provide the hash of the query you want to transform. You can find this in server logs, websocket network inspector, or in the CVR database. In a future release, you'll be able to write ZQL directly.

```ts
npx transform-query --hash=2i81bazy03a00 --schema=./shared/schema.ts
```

The output will be the ZQL query with permissions applied as well as the AST of that query.

<Note type="note">
  The printed AST is slightly different than the source ZQL string as it
  leverages internal APIs to prevent syncing rows that are used strictly for
  permission checks.
</Note>

## Write Permissions

Look for a `WARN` level log in the output from `zero-cache` like this:

```
Permission check failed for {"op":"update","tableName":"message",...}, action update, phase preMutation, authData: {...}, rowPolicies: [...], cellPolicies: []
```

Zero prints the row, auth data, and permission policies that was applied to any failed writes.

<Note>
  The ZQL query is printed in AST format. See [Query ASTs](./query-asts) to
  convert it to a more readable format.
