## Removing Zero from your project

You may want to remove Zero from your project for a variety of reasons - regardless, there are a few things you can do to completely remove Zero from your project.

### Schemas

Zero makes all its data changes to your database in its own postgres "schemas".


To list all schemas when using `psql`, you can use the following command:

```bash
psql -c "\dN"
```

There are two schemas used

`zero`

This schema is for tracking zero-related data unrelated to a replica (shared amongst all replicas). Currently there is just one table - the schema version used for migration.

`zero_0`

This schema is used for tracking zero-related data that is per-replica. In the screenshot, I have just one replica but there can be more, zero_1, zero_2, etc when you have zero running multi-node in production.

First, double check for all Zero associated schemas:


```bash
psql -c "/dt zero.*"
```

```bash
psql -c "/dt zero_0.*"
```

Which should show something like this:

and also:

<ImageLightbox src="/images/cleanup/drop-schema-2.png" alt="Example of console window showing Zero associated schemas" />


You can then drop these individually with the `DROP SCHEMA` command.

As an example, to drop the `zero` schema, you can use the following command:

```bash
psql -c "DROP SCHEMA zero CASCADE;"
```

<Note type="warning">
  **Note:** We reccomend you do these individually to avoid any mistakes.
</Note>

### Event Triggers

Zero also installs some event triggers related to schema management. These postgres features are global and can't be associated w/ schemas. To find them: 

```bash
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger;"
```
<ImageLightbox src="/images/cleanup/pg-triggers.png" alt="" />

You can drop each of these with the `DROP EVENT TRIGGER` command.

For example:

```bash
psql -c "DROP EVENT TRIGGER zero_dd1_start_0 ON pg_event_trigger;"
```

You would need repeat this command for each trigger associated with Zero
