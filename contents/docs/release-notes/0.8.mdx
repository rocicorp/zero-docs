title: Zero 0.8
description: Schema Autobuild, Result Types, and Enums
---

## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.8
```

See the changes to [hello-zero](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/pull/8) or [hello-zero-solid](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/pull/5) for example updates.

## Features

- **Schema Autobuild**. There's now a `zero-cache-dev` script that automatically rebuilds the schema and restarts `zero-cache` on changes to `schema.ts`. ([docs](../zero-schema#building-the-zero-schema))
- **Result Type.** You can now tell whether a query is complete or partial. ([docs](/docs/reading-data#partial-data))
- **Enums**. Enums are now supported in Postgres schemas and on client. ([docs](../postgres-support#column-types))
- **Custom Types**. You can define custom JSON types in your schema. ([docs](../zero-schema#custom-json-types))
- **OTEL Tracing.** Initial tracing support. ([docs](/docs/zero-cache-config#log-trace-collector))
- **timestampz.** Add support for `timestampz` Postgres column type. ([docs](../postgres-support#column-types))
- **SSLMode**. You can disable TLS when `zero-cache` connects to DB with `sslmode=disable`. ([docs](../connecting-to-postgres#ssl-mode))
- **Permission Helpers**. `ANYONE_CAN` and `NOBODY_CAN` helpers were added to make these cases more readable. ([docs](../permissions#permissions-denied-by-default))
- **Multitenant Support**. A single `zero-cache` can now front separate Postgres databases. This is useful for customers that have one "dev" database in production per-developer. ([docs](../zero-cache-config#tenants-json))

## Fixes

- **Crash with JSON Columns**. Fixed a crash when a JSON column was used in a Zero app with write permissions ([bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3215))
- **Better Connection Error Reporting**. Some connection errors would cause `zero-cache` to exit silently. Now they are returned to client and logged.

## Breaking Changes

- `useQuery` in React now returns a 2-tuple of `[rows, result]` where `result` is an object with a `type` field.
- `postProposedMutation` in write permissions for `update` renamed to `postMutation` for consistency.
- `TableScheamToRow` renamed to `Row` to not be so silly long.
