title: Supported Postgres Features
---

Postgres has a massive feature set, of which Zero supports a growings subset.

## Object Names

- Table and column names must begin with a letter or underscore
  - This can be followed letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens
  - Regex: `/^[A-Za-z_]+[A-Za-z0-9_-]*$/`
- The column name `_0_version` is reserved for internal use

## Object Types

- Tables are synced
- Views are not synced
- `identity` generated columns are synced
- All other generated columns are not synced
- Indexes aren’t _synced_ per-se but we do implicitly add indexes to the replica that match the upstream indexes. In the future this will be customizable.

## Column Types

| Postgres Type                     | Type to put in `schema.ts` | Resulting JS/TS Type |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| All numeric types                 | `number`                   | `number`             |
| `char`, `varchar`, `text`, `uuid` | `string`                   | `string`             |
| `bool`                            | `boolean`                  | `boolean`            |
| `date`, `timestamp`, `timestampz` | `number`                   | `number`             |
| `json`, `jsonb`                   | `json`                     | `JSONValue`          |
| `enum`                            | `enumeration`              | `string`             |

Other Postgres column types aren’t supported. They will be ignored when replicating (the synced data will be missing that column) and you will get a warning when `zero-cache` starts up.

If your schema has a pg type not listed here, you can support it in Zero by using a trigger to map it to some type that Zero can support. For example if you have an [enum type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-enum.html#DATATYPE-ENUM) `Mood` used by column `user_mood mood`, you can use a trigger to map it to a `user_mood_text text` column. You would then use another trigger to map changes to `user_mood_text` back to `user_mood` so that the data can be updated by Zero.

Let us know if the lack of a particular column type is hindering your use of Zero. It can likely be added.

## Column Defaults

Default values are allowed in the Postgres schema but there currently is no way to use them from a Zero app. The create mutation requires all columns to be specified, except when columns are nullable (in which case,they default to null). Since there is no way to leave non-nullable columns off the insert, there is no way for PG to apply the default. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the future.

## IDs

It is strongly recommended that primary keys be client-generated random strings like [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid), [ulid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ulid), [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid), etc. This makes optimistic creation and updates much easier.

<Note type="note" heading="Why are client-generated IDs better?">
  Imagine that the PK of your table is an auto-incrementing integer. If you optimistically create an entity of this type, you will have to give it some ID – the type will require it locally, but also if you want to optimistically create relationships to this row you’ll need an ID.

  You could sync the highest value seen for that table, but there are race conditions and it is possible for that ID to be taken by the time the creation makes it to the server. Your database can resolve this and assign the next ID, but now the relationships you created optimistically will be against the wrong row. Blech.

  GUIDs makes a lot more sense in local-first applications.

  If your table has a natural key you can use that and it has less problems. But there is still the chance for a conflict. Imagine you are modeling orgs and you choose domainName as the natural key. It is possible for a race to happen and when the creation gets to the server, somebody has already chosen that domain name. In that case, the best thing to do is reject the write and show the user an error.
</Note>

If you want to have a short auto-incrementing numeric ID for ux reasons (ie, a bug number), that is possible – See [Demo Video](https://discord.com/channels/830183651022471199/1288232858795769917/1298114323272568852)!

## Primary Keys

Each table synced with Zero must have either a primary key or at least one unique index.

This is needed so that Zero can identify rows during sync, to distinguish between an edit and a remove/add.

Multi-column primary and foreign keys are supported.

## Limiting Replication

You can use [Permissions](permissions) to limit tables and rows from replicating to Zero. In the near future you’ll also be able to use Permissions to limit individual columns.

Until then, a workaround is to use the Postgres [_publication_](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html) feature to control the tables and columns that are replicated into `zero-cache`.

In your pg schema setup, create a Postgres `publication` with the tables and columns you want:

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION zero_data FOR TABLE users (col1, col2, col3, ...), issues, comments;
```

Then, specify this publication in the [App Publications](/docs/zero-cache-config#app-publications) `zero-cache` option. (By default, Zero creates a publication that publishes the entire public schema.)

To limit what is synced from the `zero-cache` replica to actual clients (e.g., web browsers) you can use [read permissions](/docs/permissions#select-permissions).

## Schema changes

Most Postgres schema changes are supported. There are two special cases which require special handling:

### Adding columns

Adding a column (e.g. `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...`) with a non-constant `DEFAULT` value is not supported. 

This includes expressions with parenthesis, as well as special functions such as `CURRENT_TIME`, `CURRENT_DATE`, or `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.
(This is due to a [limitation of SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html#altertabaddcol)).

However, the `DEFAULT` value of an _existing_ column can be changed to any value, including expressions. To achieve the desired column default:

* Add the column with no `DEFAULT` value
* Backfill the column with desired values
* Set the column's `DEFAULT` value

```sql
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE foo ADD bar ...;  -- without a DEFAULT value
UPDATE foo SET bar = ...;
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER bar SET DEFAULT ...;
COMMIT;
```

### Changing publications

Postgres allows you to change the published tables/columns using an `ALTER PUBLICATION` statement. Zero will automatically adjust the tables and columns on the replica in response to these changes, but it will not receive any of the existing data in those tables/columns.

To stream the table data to Zero, make an innocuous `UPDATE` after adding the table/columns to the publication:

```sql
BEGIN;
ALTER PUBLICATION zero_data ADD TABLE foo;
ALTER TABLE foo REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
UPDATE foo SET id = id;  -- For some column "id" in "foo"
ALTER TABLE foo REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT;
COMMIT;
```
