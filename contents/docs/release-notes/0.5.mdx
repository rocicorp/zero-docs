title: Zero 0.5
description: JSON Columns
---

## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.5
```

## Breaking changes

- `createTableSchema` and `createSchema` moved to `@rocicorp/zero/schema` subpackage. This is in preparation to moving authorization into the schema file.
- `SchemaToRow` helper type was renamed `TableSchemaToRow` and moved into `@rocicorp/zero/schema`.

Basically:

```diff
- import { createSchema, createTableSchema, SchemaToRow } from "@rocicorp/zero";
+ import { createSchema, createTableSchema, TableSchemaToRow } from "@rocicorp/zero/schema";
```

## Features

- Added support for JSON columns in Postgres ([documentation](/docs/postgres-support)).
- Zero pacakage now includes `zero-sqlite3`, which can be used to explore our sqlite files ([documentation](/docs/debug/replication#inspecting)).

## Fixes

- We were not correctly replicating the `char(n)` type, despite documenting that we were.
