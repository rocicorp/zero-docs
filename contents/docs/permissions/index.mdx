title: Permissions
---

Permissions are expressed using [ZQL](reading-data) and run automatically with every read and write.

## Define Permissions

Permissions are defined in [`schema.ts`](/docs/zero-schema) using the `definePermissions` function.

Here's an example of limiting deletes to only the creator of an issue:

```ts
// The decoded value of your JWT.
type AuthData = {
  // The logged-in user.
  sub: string;
};

export const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<IssueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        delete: [allowIfIssueCreator],
      },
    },
  };
});
```

`definePermission` returns a _policy_ object for each table in the schema. Each policy defines a _ruleset_ for the _operations_ that are possible on a table: `select`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.

## Access is Denied by Default

If you don't specify any rules for an operation, it is denied by default. This is an important safety feature that helps ensure data isn't accidentally exposed.

To enable full access to an action (i.e., during development) use the `ANYONE_CAN` helper:

```ts
import { ANYONE_CAN } from '@rocicorp/zero';

const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        select: ANYONE_CAN,
        // Other operations are denied by default.
      },
    },
    // Other tables are denied by default.
  };
});
```

To do this for all actions, use `ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING`:

```ts
import { ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING } from '@rocicorp/zero';

const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  return {
    // All operations on issue are allowed to all users.
    issue: ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING,

    // Other tables are denied by default.
  };
});
```

## Permission Evaluation

Zero permissions are "compiled" into a JSON-based format at build-time. This file is stored in the `zero.permissions` table of your upstream database. Like other tables, it replicates live down to `zero-cache`. `zero-cache` then parses this file, and applies the encoded rules to every read and write operation.

<Note type="warning">
The compilation process is very simple-minded (read: dumb). Despite looking like normal TypeScript functions that receive an `AuthData` parameter, rule functions are not actually invoked at runtime. Instead, they are invoked with a "placeholder" `AuthData` at build time. We track which fields of this placeholder are accessed and construct a ZQL expression that accesses the right field of `AuthData` at runtime.

The end result is that you can't really use most features of JS in these rules. Specifically you cannot:

* Iterate over properties or array elements in the auth token
* Use any JS features beyond property access of `AuthData`
* Use any conditional or global state

Basically only property access is allowed. This is really confusing and we're working on a better solution.

## Permission Deployment

During development, permissions are compiled and uploaded to your database completely automatically as part of the `zero-cache-dev` script.

For production, you need to call `npx zero-deploy-permissions` within your app to update the permissions in the production database whenever they change. You would typically do this as part of your normal schema migration or CI process. For example, the SST deployment script for [zbugs](/docs/samples#zbugs) does this as part of a serverless function that is invoked on every deploy:

```ts
// permissions.ts
import { execSync } from "node:child_process";

export const deploy = () =>
  execSync("npx zero-deploy-permissions", { stdio: "inherit" });
```

See the [SST Deployment Guide](deployment#guide-multi-node-on-sstaws) for more details.

## Rules

Each operation on a policy has a _ruleset_ containing zero or more _rules_.

A rule is just a TypeScript function that receives the logged in user's `AuthData` and generates a ZQL [where expression](reading-data#compound-filters). At least one rule in a ruleset must return a row for the operation to be allowed.

## Select Permissions

You can limit the data a user can read by specifying a `select` ruleset.

Select permissions act like filters. If a user does not have permission to read a row, it will be filtered out of the result set. It will not generate an error.

For example, imagine a select permission that restricts reads to only issues created by the user:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        select: [allowIfIssueCreator],
      },
    },
  };
});
```

If the issue table has two rows, one created by the user and one by someone else, the user will only see the row they created in any queries.

## Insert Permissions

You can limit what rows can be inserted and by whom by specifying an `insert` ruleset.

Insert rules are evaluated after the entity is inserted. So if they query the database, they will see the inserted row present. If any rule in the insert ruleset returns a row, the insert is allowed.

Here's an example of an insert rule that disallows inserting users that have the role 'admin'.

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfNonAdmin = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof userSchema>,
  ) => cmp('role', '!=', 'admin');

  return {
    user: {
      row: {
        insert: [allowIfNonAdmin],
      },
    },
  };
});
```

## Update Permissions

There are two types of update rulesets: `preMutation` and `postMutation`. Both rulesets must pass for an update to be allowed.

`preMutation` rules see the version of a row _before_ the mutation is applied. This is useful for things like checking whether a user owns an entity before editing it.

`postMutation` rules see the version of a row _after_ the mutation is applied. This is useful for things like ensuring a user can only mark themselves as the creator of an entity and not other users.

Like other rulesets, `preMutation` and `postMutation` default to `NOBODY_CAN`. This means that every table must define both these rulesets in order for any updates to be allowed.

For example, the following ruleset allows an issue's owner to edit, but **not** re-assign the issue. The `postMutation` rule enforces that the current user still own the issue after edit.

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueOwner = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('ownerID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        update: {
          preMutation: [allowIfIssueOwner],
          postMutation: [allowIfIssueOwner],
        },
      },
    },
  };
});
```

This ruleset allows an issue's owner to edit and re-assign the issue:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueOwner = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('ownerID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        update: {
          preMutation: [allowIfIssueOwner],
          postMutation: ANYONE_CAN,
        },
      },
    },
  };
});
```

And this allows anyone to edit an issue, but only if they also assign it to themselves. Useful for enforcing *"patches welcome"*? 🙃

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueOwner = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('ownerID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        update: {
          preMutation: ANYONE_CAN,
          postMutation: [allowIfIssueOwner],
        },
      },
    },
  };
});
```


## Delete Permissions

Delete permissions work in the same way as `insert` positions except they run _before_ the delete is applied. So if a delete rule queries the database, it will see that the deleted row is present. If any rule in the ruleset returns a row, the delete is allowed.

## Debugging Permissions

To debug read permissions, you can set the `zero-cache` [log level](./zero-cache-config#log-level) to `debug`. Zero prints out the full query for each read with permissions applied.

To debug write permissions, look for a `WARN` level log in the output from `zero-cache` like this:

```
Permission check failed for {"op":"update","tableName":"message",...}, action update, phase preMutation, authData: {...}, rowPolicies: [...], cellPolicies: []
```

Zero prints the row, auth data, and permission policies that was applied to any failed writes.

<Note>
For both types of permissions, the ZQL query is printed in Zero's internal JSON-based AST format. This is a little harder to read than the ZQL you write, but should help you understand what is going on. We'll improve this over time.
