title: zero-cache Config
---

`zero-cache` is configured either via CLI flag or environment variable. There is no separate `zero.config` file.

You can also see all available flags by running `zero-cache --help`.

## Required Flags

### Upstream DB

The "upstream" authoritative postgres database. In the future we will support other types of upstream besides PG.

flag: `--upstream-db`<br/>
env: `ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB`<br/>
required: `true`

### Replica File

File path to the SQLite replica that zero-cache maintains. This can be lost, but if it is, zero-cache will have to re-replicate next time it starts up.

flag: `--replica-file`<br/>
env: `ZERO_REPLICA_FILE`<br/>
required: `true`

### Auth

One of [Auth JWK](#auth-jwk), [Auth JWK URL](#auth-jwk-url), or [Auth Secret](#auth-secret) must be specified. See [Authentication](/docs/auth/) for more details.

## Optional Flags

### Push URL

The URL of the API server to which zero-cache will push mutations. Required if you use [custom mutators](/docs/custom-mutators).

flag: `--push-url`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PUSH_URL`<br/>
required: `false`

### Upstream Max Connections

The maximum number of connections to open to the upstream database for committing mutations. This is divided evenly amongst sync workers. In addition to this number, zero-cache uses one connection for the replication stream.

Note that this number must allow for at least one connection per sync worker, or zero-cache will fail to start. See num-sync-workers.

flag: `--upstream-max-conns`<br/>
env: `ZERO_UPSTREAM_MAX_CONNS`<br/>
default: `20`

### CVR DB

The Postgres database used to store CVRs. CVRs (client view records) keep track of the data synced to clients in order to determine the diff to send on reconnect. If unspecified, the upstream-db will be used.

flag: `--cvr-db`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CVR_DB`<br/>
required: `false`

### CVR Max Connections

The maximum number of connections to open to the CVR database. This is divided evenly amongst sync workers.

Note that this number must allow for at least one connection per sync worker, or zero-cache will fail to start. See num-sync-workers.

flag: `--cvr-max-conns`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CVR_MAX_CONNS`<br/>
default: `30`

### Change DB

The Postgres database used to store recent replication log entries, in order to sync multiple view-syncers without requiring multiple replication slots on the upstream database. If unspecified, the upstream-db will be used.

flag: `--change-db`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_DB`<br/>
required: `false`

### Change Max Connections

The maximum number of connections to open to the change database. This is used by the change-streamer for catching up zero-cache replication subscriptions.

flag: `--change-max-conns`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_MAX_CONNS`<br/>
default: `5`

### Replica Vacuum Interval Hours

Performs a VACUUM at server startup if the specified number of hours has elapsed since the last VACUUM (or initial-sync). The VACUUM operation is heavyweight and requires double the size of the db in disk space. If unspecified, VACUUM operations are not performed.

flag: `--replica-vacuum-interval-hours`<br/>
env: `ZERO_REPLICA_VACUUM_INTERVAL_HOURS`<br/>
required: `false`

### Log Level

Sets the logging level for the application.

flag: `--log-level`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_LEVEL`<br/>
default: `"info"`<br/>
values: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

### Log Format

Use text for developer-friendly console logging and json for consumption by structured-logging services.

flag: `--log-format`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_FORMAT`<br/>
default: `"text"`<br/>
values: `text`, `json`

### Log Trace Collector

The URL of the trace collector to which to send trace data. Traces are sent over http. Port defaults to 4318 for most collectors.

flag: `--log-trace-collector`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_TRACE_COLLECTOR`<br/>
required: `false`

### Log Slow Row Threshold

The number of ms a row must take to fetch from table-source before it is considered slow.

flag: `--log-slow-row-threshold`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_SLOW_ROW_THRESHOLD`<br/>
default: `2`

### Log Slow Hydrate Threshold

The number of milliseconds a query hydration must take to print a slow warning.

flag: `--log-slow-hydrate-threshold`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_SLOW_HYDRATE_THRESHOLD`<br/>
default: `100`

### Log IVM Sampling

How often to collect IVM metrics. 1 out of N requests will be sampled where N is this value.

flag: `--log-ivm-sampling`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_IVM_SAMPLING`<br/>
default: `5000`

### Target Client Row Count

A soft limit on the number of rows Zero will keep on the client. 20k is a good default value for most applications, and we do not recommend exceeding 100k. See [Client Capacity Management](/docs/reading-data#client-capacity-management) for more details.

flag: `--target-client-row-count`<br/>
env: `ZERO_TARGET_CLIENT_ROW_COUNT`<br/>
default: `20000`

### App ID

Unique identifier for the app.

Multiple zero-cache apps can run on a single upstream database, each of which is isolated from the others, with its own permissions, sharding (future feature), and change/cvr databases.

The metadata of an app is stored in an upstream schema with the same name, e.g. `zero`, and the metadata for each app shard, e.g. client and mutation ids, is stored in the `{app-id}_{#}` schema. (Currently there is only a single "0" shard, but this will change with sharding).

The CVR and Change data are managed in schemas named `{app-id}_{shard-num}/cvr` and `{app-id}_{shard-num}/cdc`, respectively, allowing multiple apps and shards to share the same database instance (e.g. a Postgres "cluster") for CVR and Change management.

Due to constraints on replication slot names, an App ID may only consist of lower-case letters, numbers, and the underscore character.

Note that this option is used by both `zero-cache` and `zero-deploy-permissions`.

flag: `--app-id`<br/>
env: `ZERO_APP_ID`<br/>
default: `zero`

### App Publications

Postgres PUBLICATIONs that define the tables and columns to replicate. Publication names may not begin with an underscore, as zero reserves that prefix for internal use.

If unspecified, zero-cache will create and use an internal publication that publishes all tables in the public schema, i.e.:

```
CREATE PUBLICATION _{app-id}_public_0 FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA public;
```

Note that once an app has begun syncing data, this list of publications cannot be changed, and zero-cache will refuse to start if a specified value differs from what was originally synced. To use a different set of publications, a new app should be created.

flag: `--app-publications`<br/>
env: `ZERO_APP_PUBLICATIONS`<br/>
default: `[]`

### Auth JWK

A public key in JWK format used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set.

flag: `--auth-jwk`<br/>
env: `ZERO_AUTH_JWK`<br/>
required: `false`

### Auth JWK URL

A URL that returns a JWK set used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set.

flag: `--auth-jwks-url`<br/>
env: `ZERO_AUTH_JWKS_URL`<br/>
required: `false`

### Auth Secret

A symmetric key used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set.

flag: `--auth-secret`<br/>
env: `ZERO_AUTH_SECRET`<br/>
required: `false`

### Port

The port for sync connections.

flag: `--port`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PORT`<br/>
default: `4848`

### Change Streamer Port

The port on which the change-streamer runs. This is an internal protocol between the replication-manager and zero-cache, which runs in the same process in local development. If unspecified, defaults to --port + 1.

flag: `--change-streamer-port`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_PORT`<br/>
required: `false`

### Task ID

Globally unique identifier for the zero-cache instance. Setting this to a platform specific task identifier can be useful for debugging. If unspecified, zero-cache will attempt to extract the TaskARN if run from within an AWS ECS container, and otherwise use a random string.

flag: `--task-id`<br/>
env: `ZERO_TASK_ID`<br/>
required: `false`

### Per User Mutation Limit Max

The maximum mutations per user within the specified windowMs.

flag: `--per-user-mutation-limit-max`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PER_USER_MUTATION_LIMIT_MAX`<br/>
required: `false`

### Per User Mutation Limit Window (ms)

The sliding window over which the perUserMutationLimitMax is enforced.

flag: `--per-user-mutation-limit-window-ms`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PER_USER_MUTATION_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`<br/>
default: `60000`

### Number of Sync Workers

The number of processes to use for view syncing. Leave this unset to use the maximum available parallelism. If set to 0, the server runs without sync workers, which is the configuration for running the replication-manager.

flag: `--num-sync-workers`<br/>
env: `ZERO_NUM_SYNC_WORKERS`<br/>
required: `false`

### Change Streamer URI

When unset, the zero-cache runs its own replication-manager (i.e. change-streamer). In production, this should be set to the replication-manager URI, which runs a change-streamer on port 4849.

flag: `--change-streamer-uri`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI`<br/>
required: `false`

### Auto Reset

Automatically wipe and resync the replica when replication is halted. This situation can occur for configurations in which the upstream database provider prohibits event trigger creation, preventing the zero-cache from being able to correctly replicate schema changes. For such configurations, an upstream schema change will instead result in halting replication with an error indicating that the replica needs to be reset. When auto-reset is enabled, zero-cache will respond to such situations by shutting down, and when restarted, resetting the replica and all synced clients. This is a heavy-weight operation and can result in user-visible slowness or downtime if compute resources are scarce.

flag: `--auto-reset`<br/>
env: `ZERO_AUTO_RESET`<br/>
default: `true`

### Query Hydration Stats

Track and log the number of rows considered by each query in the system. This is useful for debugging and performance tuning.

flag: `--query-hydration-stats`<br/>
env: `ZERO_QUERY_HYDRATION_STATS`<br/>
required: `false`

### Litestream Executable

Path to the litestream executable. This option has no effect if litestream-backup-url is unspecified.

flag: `--litestream-executable`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_EXECUTABLE`<br/>
required: `false`

### Litestream Config Path

Path to the litestream yaml config file. zero-cache will run this with its environment variables, which can be referenced in the file via `${ENV}` substitution, for example:

- ZERO_REPLICA_FILE for the db Path
- ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_LOCATION for the db replica url
- ZERO_LITESTREAM_LOG_LEVEL for the log Level
- ZERO_LOG_FORMAT for the log type

flag: `--litestream-config-path`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_CONFIG_PATH`<br/>
default: `./src/services/litestream/config.yml`

### Litestream Log Level

flag: `--litestream-log-level`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_LOG_LEVEL`<br/>
default: `warn`
values: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

### Litestream Backup URL

The location of the litestream backup, usually an s3:// URL. If set, the litestream-executable must also be specified.

flag: `--litestream-backup-url`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_URL`<br/>
required: `false`

### Litestream Checkpoint Threshold MB

The size of the WAL file at which to perform an SQlite checkpoint to apply the writes in the WAL to the main database file. Each checkpoint creates a new WAL segment file that will be backed up by litestream. Smaller thresholds may improve read performance, at the expense of creating more files to download when restoring the replica from the backup.

flag: `--litestream-checkpoint-threshold-mb`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_CHECKPOINT_THRESHOLD_MB`<br/>
default: `40`

### Litestream Incremental Backup Interval Minutes

The interval between incremental backups of the replica. Shorter intervals reduce the amount of change history that needs to be replayed when catching up a new view-syncer, at the expense of increasing the number of files needed to download for the initial litestream restore.

flag: `--litestream-incremental-backup-interval-minutes`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_INCREMENTAL_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES`<br/>
default: `15`

### Litestream Snapshot Backup Interval Hours

The interval between snapshot backups of the replica. Snapshot backups make a full copy of the database to a new litestream generation. This improves restore time at the expense of bandwidth. Applications with a large database and low write rate can increase this interval to reduce network usage for backups (litestream defaults to 24 hours).

flag: `--litestream-snapshot-backup-interval-hours`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_SNAPSHOT_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`<br/>
default: `12`

### Litestream Restore Parallelism

The number of WAL files to download in parallel when performing the initial restore of the replica from the backup.

flag: `--litestream-restore-parallelism`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_RESTORE_PARALLELISM`<br/>
default: `48`

### Storage DB Temp Dir

Temporary directory for IVM operator storage. Leave unset to use `os.tmpdir()`.

flag: `--storage-db-tmp-dir`<br/>
env: `ZERO_STORAGE_DB_TMP_DIR`<br/>
required: `false`

### Initial Sync Table Copy Workers

The number of parallel workers used to copy tables during initial sync. Each worker copies a single table at a time, fetching rows in batches of `initial-sync-row-batch-size`.

flag: `--initial-sync-table-copy-workers`<br/>
env: `ZERO_INITIAL_SYNC_TABLE_COPY_WORKERS`<br/>
default: `5`

### Initial Sync Row Batch Size

The number of rows each table copy worker fetches at a time during initial sync. This can be increased to speed up initial sync, or decreased to reduce the amount of heap memory used during initial sync (e.g. for tables with large rows).

flag: `--initial-sync-row-batch-size`<br/>
env: `ZERO_INITIAL_SYNC_ROW_BATCH_SIZE`<br/>
default: `10000`

### Server Version

The version string outputted to logs when the server starts up.

flag: `--server-version`<br/>
env: `ZERO_SERVER_VERSION`<br/>
required: `false`

### Tenants JSON

JSON encoding of per-tenant configs for running the server in multi-tenant mode:

```json
{
  /**
  * Requests to the main application port are dispatched to the first tenant
  * with a matching host and path. If both host and path are specified,
  * both must match for the request to be dispatched to that tenant.
  *
  * Requests can also be sent directly to the ZERO_PORT specified
  * in a tenant's env overrides. In this case, no host or path
  * matching is necessary.
  */
  tenants: {
    id: string;     // value of the "tid" context key in debug logs
    host?: string;  // case-insensitive full Host: header match
    path?: string;  // first path component, with or without leading slash

    /**
      * Options are inherited from the main application (e.g. args and ENV) by default,
      * and are overridden by values in the tenant's env object.
      */
    env: {
      ZERO_REPLICA_DB_FILE: string
      ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB: string
      ZERO_CVR_DB: string
      ZERO_CHANGE_DB: string
      ...
    };
  }[];
}
```

flag: `--tenants-json`<br/>
env: `ZERO_TENANTS_JSON`<br/>
required: `false`<br/>
