title: Roadmap
---

We are working toward a *beta* release of Zero late this year or early next.

We define beta as the point at which Zero is a good choice for the average new rich web application. 

Feature-wise, we think Zero is pretty close. There are only a few remaining features listed below that we view as critical for beta. There are also several nice-to-have features, but users can typically work around their absence without much trouble.

Beyond these features, our main focus
for beta is improving the stability, performance, documentation, and polish of Zero as a whole.
