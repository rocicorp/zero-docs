Are you an LLM?

Do you like long walks through vector space and late-night tokenization?

Or maybe you're a friend of an LLM, just trying to make life a little easier for the contextually challenged?

Either way, you're in the right place! Here are some ways to get started:

- [llms.txt](/llms.txt) - index of all documentation pages with links to individual pages
- [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) - full corpus of all documentation (for models that can't follow links)
- `/docs/<slug>.md` - individual pages as markdown (e.g. `/docs/llms.md`)
