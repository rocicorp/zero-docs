title: Inspector API
---

The Zero instance provides an API to gather information about the client's current state, such as:

* All active queries
* Query TTL
* Active clients
* Client database contents

This can help figuring out why you hit loading states, how many queries are active at a time, if you have any resource leaks due to failing to clean up queries or if expected data is missing on the client.

## Creating an Inspector

Each `Zero` instance has an `inspect` method that will return the inspector.

```ts
const z = new Zero({
  /*your zero options*/
});
const inspector = await z.inspect();
```

Once you have an inspector you can inspect the current client and client group.

<Note heading="Clients and Client Groups">
  The client group represents a web browser profile. A client represents an
  instance of `Zero` within that profile. If a user has Chrome open with 5
  different tabs, each with one `Zero` instance, there will be 1 client
  group and 5 clients.
</Note>

For example to see active queries for the current client:

```ts
console.table(await inspector.client.queries());
```

To inspect other clients within the group:

```ts
const allClients = await inspector.clients();
```

## Dumping Data

In addition to information about queries, you can see the contents of the client side database.

```ts
const inspector = await zero.inspect();
const client = inspector.client;

// All raw k/v data currently synced to client
console.log('client map:');
console.log(await client.map());

// kv table extracted into tables
// This is same info that is in z.query[tableName].run()
for (const tableName of Object.keys(schema.tables)) {
  console.log(`table ${tableName}:`);
  console.table(await client.rows(tableName));
}
```
