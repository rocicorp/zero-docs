## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.21
```

## Upgrading

There is one [breaking change](#breaking-changes) in this release, but we think it is unlikely to affect anyone since the results were wrong already â€“ the change just makes the error explicit.

See [hello-zero](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/pull/44) for an example of using arrays and the new `ZeroProvider` features.

## Features

- New _"ztunes"_ sample using TanStack, Drizzle, Better Auth, and Fly.io ([docs](/docs/samples#ztunes)).
- Add initial support for Postgres arrays ([docs](/docs/postgres-support#column-types), [bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3617)).
- Improved React lifecycle management with `ZeroProvider` ([docs](/docs/react#zero-provider), [PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4527)).
- Expose `Zero` instances automatically at `__zero` ([docs](/docs/debug/inspector#creating-an-inspector), [PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4526)).
- Add `--output-{synced|vended}-rows` to `analyze-query` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4463)).
- Technically a bug fix, but this was so annoying I'm calling it a feature: <nobr>`zero-sqlite3`</nobr> now correctly supports the up/down arrow keys ([commit](https://github.com/rocicorp/zero-sqlite3/commit/50c7a850572d9d3d4ac26ffb2e1cca2e8c5e08b0)).
- Another super annoying fix: logs from `zero-cache` are now level-colored ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4533)).

## Fixes

- Lazy-load otel. This was causing problems with `pnpm` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4492)).
- Initial replication is now memory-bounded ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4408)).
- Change the way otel starts up in `zero-cache-dev` to not rely on `npx` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4448)).
- Use existing `--log-slow-hydrate-threshold` as the threshold for `--query-hydration-stats` rather than hardcoded 200ms.
- Fix race condition starting up in multinode deployments ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4400)).
- Avoid site-local IPv6 addresses in auto-discovery ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4414)).
- Many z2s fixes found by fuzzing (PRs: [4415](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4415), [4416](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4416), [4417](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4417), [4421](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4421), [4422](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4422), [4423](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4423)).
- Don't load prettier in `analyze-query`. This was causing problems when prettier config was cjs. ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4441)).
- Don't hydrate system relationships in `analyze-query`. This was causing incorrect results. ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4458)).
- Fix memory leaks from not cleaning up `pusher` and `mutagen` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4481)).
- Fix handling of invalid websocket requests that were crashing server. ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4490)).
- Remove red error text when `.env` missing ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4523)).
- Allow `zero-cache` to startup without schema file, but print a warning ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4531)).
- Log a warning when auth token exceeds max allowed header size ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4535)).

## Breaking Changes

- Using `order by` and `limit` in many-to-many relationships now throws an error. It didn't work before but did the wrong thing silently. Now it throws a runtime error. See [docs](/docs/reading-data#order-and-limit-not-supported-in-junction-relationships), [bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3527).
