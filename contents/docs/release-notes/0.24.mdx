title: Zero 0.24
description: Join Flipping, Cookie Auth, Previews
---

## About

This release adds [*join flipping*](/docs/reading-data#join-flipping), a way to hint to ZQL the order joins should happen in. This is a major benefit for queries that use `whereExists()`. Since almost all Zero applications use `whereExists()` to implement features like permissions and label filters, this should improve performance for most applications.

There are also several other major new features and many bug fixes.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.24
```

## Breaking Changes

1. If you are using the `push.url` param to the `Zero` constructor, rename it to `mutateURL` ([more info](/docs/custom-mutators#custom-mutate-url)).
2. If you are using the `ZERO_PUSH_URL` config param, rename it to `ZERO_MUTATE_URL` ([more info](/docs/custom-mutators#custom-mutate-url)).
3. If you are awaiting queries directly without calling `run()`, like `await z.query.foo.where(...)`, or `await tx.query.foo.where(...)`, add `.run()` to the end, like `await z.query.foo.where(...).run()` or `await tx.query.foo.where(...).run()`.. This is most common in custom mutator implementations ([more info](/docs/reading-data#default-run))
4. Add a `ZERO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var to your production config. This is now required ([more info](/docs/zero-cache-config#admin-password))

## Example Upgrades

* [ztunes](https://github.com/rocicorp/ztunes/pull/23)
* [zslack](https://github.com/rocicorp/zslack/pull/12)
* [hello-zero-solid](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/pull/27)
* [hello-zero](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/pull/50) â€“ Note that we are keeping `hello-zero` on the legacy query and mutator APIs until they are deprecated, for testing reasons. So this PR doesn't include custom mutator, synced query, or auth-related changes.
