title: Zero 0.7
description: Read Permissions and Docker
---

## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.7
```

## Features

- **Read permissions.** You can now control read access to data using ZQL ([docs](../permissions#select-permissions)).
- **Deployment.** We now have a single-node Docker container ([docs](../deployment/)). Future work will add multinode support.
- **Compound FKs.** Zero already supported compound _primary_ keys, but now it also supports compound _foreign_ keys ([docs](../zero-schema#relationships-and-compound-keys)).
- **Schema DX**:
  - Columns types can use bare strings now if `optional` is not needed ([example](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/commit/212379241e27e717f1237946f3384127d06661c3#diff-01e627d4886ffc106a9f60c5ea65f35b3868ad4de898cecf7ae60329b11c22e7R13)).
  - PK can be a single string in the common case where itâ€™s non-compound ([example](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/commit/212379241e27e717f1237946f3384127d06661c3#diff-01e627d4886ffc106a9f60c5ea65f35b3868ad4de898cecf7ae60329b11c22e7R19)).

## Breaking Changes

- Several changes to `schema.ts`. See [update](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/commits/main/) to `hello-zero` for overview. Details:
  - `defineAuthorization` was renamed to `definedPermissions` to avoid confusion with _authentication_.
  - The way that many:many relationships are defined has changed to be more general and easy to remember. See example.
  - The signature of `definePermissions` and the related rule functions have changed:
    - Now rules return an _expression_ instead of full query. This was required to make read permissions work and we did it for write permissions for consitency (see example).
    - The `update` policy now has two child policies: `preMutation` and `postMutation`. The rules we used to have were `preMutation`. They run before a change and can be used to validate a user has permission to change a row. The `postMutation` rules run after and can be used to limit the changes a user is allowed to make.
  - The `schema.ts` file should export an object having two fields: `schema` and `permissions`.
- The way that `schema.ts` is consumed has also changed. Rather than `zero-cache` directly reading the typescript source, we compile it to JSON and read that. ([example](TODO)).
  - `ZERO_SCHEMA_FILE` should now point to a JSON file, not `.ts`. It defaults to `./zero-schema.json` which weâ€™ve found to be pretty useful so youâ€™ll probably just remove this key from your `.env` entirely.
  - Use `npx zero-build-schema` to generate the JSON. You must currently do this manually each time you change the schema, we will automate it soon.

<Note type="note">
  We compile the schema to JSON so that we can use it on the server without
  needing a TS toolchain there. Also so that we can run a SaaS in the future
  without needing to run user code.

## zbugs

- Comments [now have permalinks](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3067#comment-qt7YPQxXsBMBqcOkkO1pY). Implementing permalinks in an SPA with local-first [is fun](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/commit/384d0955a3998d68d293985b0de89c5302076ec5)!
- Private issues. Zbugs now supports private (to team only) issues. I wonder whatâ€™s in them â€¦ ðŸ‘€.

## Docs

- [The docs have moved](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/). Please donâ€™t use Notion anymore, they wonâ€™t be updated.
