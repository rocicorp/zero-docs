title: Permissions

Permissions are expressed using [ZQL](reading-data) and run automatically with every read and write.

## Define Permissions

Permissions are defined in [`schema.ts`](/docs/zero-schema) using the `definePermissions` function.

Here's an example of limiting deletes to only the creator of an issue:

```ts
// The decoded value of your JWT.
type AuthData = {
  // The logged-in user.
  sub: string;
};

export const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<IssueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        delete: [allowIfIssueCreator],
      },
    },
  };
});
```

`definePermission` returns a _policy_ object for each table in the schema. Each policy defines a _ruleset_ for the _operations_ that are possible on a table: `select`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.

<Note type="danger">
If a policy is not defined for a table or operation, Zero currently ***allows*** the operation.

This is not a very safe default, but it is productive. We will likely flip this default in the future.

</Note>

## Rules

Each operation on a policy has a _ruleset_ containing zero or more _rules_.

A rule is just a TypeScript function that receives the logged in user's `AuthData` and generates a ZQL [where expression](reading-data#compound-filters). At least one rule in a ruleset must return a row for the operation to be allowed.

<Note type="warning">
Although they look like normal TypeScript functions, permission rules are "compiled" into a [JSON/ZQL format](zero-cache-config#schema-file) at build-time. Those JSON rules are uploaded to zero-cache and *that's* what is evaluated.

Despite receiving an `AuthData` parameter, these functions aren't really ever run against a real `AuthData` value. They are instead run against a "placeholder" `AuthData` at build time. We track which fields of this placeholder are accessed and construct a ZQL expression that accesses the right field of `AuthData` at runtime.

This is confusing and we will be reworking it to make what's really happening more clear.

In the meantime, what you need to understand is that the only JS that is supported in these rules is accessing fields and subfields.

Specifically you cannot:

* Iterate over properties or array elements in the auth token
* Use any JS features beyond property access of `AuthData`
* Use any conditional or global state
</Note>

## Select Permissions

You can limit the data a user can read by specifying a `select` ruleset.

Select permissions act like filters. If a user does not have permission to read a row, it will be filtered out of the result set. It will not generate an error.

For example, imagine a select permission that restricts reads to only issues created by the user:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      select: [allowIfIssueCreator],
    },
  };
});
```

If the issue table has two rows, one created by the user and one by someone else, the user will only see the row they created in any queries.

## Insert Permissions

You can limit what rows can be inserted and by whom by specifying an `insert` ruleset.

Insert rules are evaluated after the entity is inserted. So if they query the database, they will see the inserted row present. If any rule in the insert ruleset returns a row, the insert is allowed.

Here's an example of an insert rule that disallows inserting users that have the role 'admin'.

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfNonAdmin = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof userSchema>,
  ) => cmp('role', '!=', 'admin');

  return {
    user: {
      insert: [allowIfNonAdmin],
    },
  };
});
```

## Update Permissions

There are two types of update rulesets: `preMutation` and `postMutation`.

`preMutation` rules see the version of a row _before_ the mutation is applied. This is useful for things like checking whether a user owns an entity before editing it.

`postMutation` rules see the version of a row _after_ the mutation is applied. This is useful for things like ensuring a user can only mark themselves as the creator of an entity and not other users.

Both the `preMutation` and `postMutation` rulesets must allow an update. But note that as with other rulesets, if either `preMutation` or `postMutation` ruleset is undefined, it defaults to **_allow_**.

So this allows an edit if the user is the creator of the issue:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      preMutation: [allowIfIssueCreator],
      // postMutation defaults to _allow_.
    },
  };
});
```

And this allows an edit if the the logged in user is the creator after the edit:

```ts
const definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  const allowIfIssueCreator = (
    authData: AuthData,
    {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<typeof issueSchema>,
  ) => cmp('creatorID', '=', authData.sub);

  return {
    issue: {
      // preMutation defaults to _allow_.
      postMutation: [allowIfIssueCreator],
    },
  };
});
```

## Delete Permissions

Delete permissions work in the same way as `insert` positions except they run _before_ the delete is applied. So if a delete rule queries the database, it will see that the deleted row is present. If any rule in the ruleset returns a row, the delete is allowed.

## Helpers

Zero defines the `ANYONE_CAN` and `NOBODY_CAN` helpers to make these common cases more readable. They are just named constants for `undefined` (anyone) and `[]` (nobody).

```ts
export const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => {
  return {
    issue: {
      row: {
        // anyone can insert issues
        insert: ANYONE_CAN,
        // nobody can delete issues
        delete: NOBODY_CAN,
      },
    },
  };
});
```
