description: Full Supabase support, performance improvements
---

## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.20
```

## Upgrading

There are two config changes for multinode deployments:

* **Required:** Remove `view-syncer`'s `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI` env var and replace it with `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_MODE: "discover"`.
* **Optional:** Change the `ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_URL` env var from being passed to both `replication-manager` and `view-syncer` nodes to being passed only to `replication-manager`. This config is no longer needed by `view-syncer` (and is ignored by it).

See [hello-zero](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/pull/40/files#diff-6ae5efcb80db51f4b137515e1674caaf950405317e84e2961cf38f9d3a1804b9) for an upgrade example using SST.

Additionally, the `ZERO_TENANTS_JSON`, feature was removed. We do not think anyone was using it, but if you were please [reach out to us](https://discord.rocicorp.dev/) for options.

## Features

- Supabase is now fully supported. After upgrading, you should see that schema changes are incremental and don't reset the replica ([docs](/docs/connecting-to-postgres)).
- Improve performance of single-key reads on client. Scale depends on size of data but 100x improvement is common ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4327)).
- Implement short-circuiting for `or` queries. Because of permissions, one or more branches of `or` would often be empty, turning the entire `or` into a full-table scan. 100x improvement on chinook test dataset ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4339)).
- Remove DNF conversion. This was intended to make consistency easier in the future, but was resulting in some queries exploding in size ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4386), [bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3569)).
- Autodiscovery for `replication-manager`. `view-syncer` nodes now find `replication-manager` using the Postgres `changedb` database, and no longer need an internal load balancer. See the new `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_MODE: "discover"` config in the [deployment docs](/docs/deployment) ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4335)).
- Make `ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_URL` specific to `replication-manager`. `view-syncer` nodes now ignore this config and learn it from `replication-manager` instead. This makes restarting replication less error-prone ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4344), [discussion](https://discord.com/channels/830183651022471199/1370898291721506876/1371685592152150057)).
- OpenTelemetry support ([docs](/docs/debug/otel)).

## Fixes

- Allow dots in column names (only works with custom mutators) ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4323)).
- Fix websocket liveness check to avoid false negatives when busy ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4321)).
- Fix unhandled exception in `zero-cache` when processing query eviction ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4322)).
- Keep microsecond precision across timezones ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4257)).
- Fix unhandled exception in `zero-cache` during `handleClose` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4326)).
- Fix `NOT IN` in `z2s` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4329)).
- Mutators: assert provided columns actually exist ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4337)).
- Fix ordering of columns in replicated index ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4362)).
- Use a shorter keepalive for replication stream for compat with Neon ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4363)).
- Allow destructuring `where` in `query.related` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4366)).
- Add flow control for large change DB transactions ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4371)).
- Fix `z2s` handling of pg types with params (char, varchar, numeric, etc) ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4361)).
- Support `from` and `--schema-path` in `analyze-query` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4368)).

## Breaking Changes

- The autodiscovery feature for `replication-manager` is a breaking change for multinode deployments. See the [upgrade instructions](#upgrading) for details.
- The `ZERO_TENANTS_JSON` config was removed ðŸ«—.
- The `ZERO_INITIAL_SYNC_ROW_BATCH_SIZE` config was removed. It is no longer needed because initial sync now adapts to available memory automatically.
