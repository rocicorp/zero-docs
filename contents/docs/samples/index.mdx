## zbugs

[zbugs](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/) is a complete issue tracker in the style of Linear built with Zero.

Not just a demo app, this is the Rocicorp’s actual issue tracker. We use it everyday and depend on it. When Zero launches publicly this will be our public issue tracker, not GitHub.

  alt="hello-zero-do demo"
/>

Same as `zero-hello` and `zero-hello-solid` above, but demonstrates Cloudflare Durable Objects integration.

This sample runs `zero-client` within a Durable Object and monitors changes to a Zero query. This can be used to do things like send notifications, update external services, etc.
