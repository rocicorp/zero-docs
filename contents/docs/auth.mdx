title: Authentication
---

Zero uses a [JWT](https://jwt.io/)-based flow to authenticate connections to zero-cache.

## Frontend

During login:

1. Your API server creates a `JWT` and sends it to your client.
2. Your client constructs a `Zero` instance with this token by passing it to the `auth` option.

<Note type="note">
  When you set the `auth` option you must set the `userID` option to the same
  value that is present in the `sub` field of the token.
</Note>

```ts
const zero = new Zero({
  ...,
  auth: token, // your JWT
  userID, // this must match the `sub` field from `token`
});
```

## Server

For `zero-cache` to be able to verify the JWT, one of the following environment variables needs to be set:

1. `ZERO_AUTH_SECRET` - If your API server uses a symmetric key (secret) to create JWTs then this is that same key.
2. `ZERO_AUTH_JWK` - If your API server uses a private key to create JWTs then this is the corresponding public key, in [JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) format.
3. `ZERO_AUTH_JWKS_URL` - Many auth providers host the public keys used to verify the JWTs they create at a public URL. If you use a provider that does this, or you publish your own keys publicly, set this to that URL.

## Refresh

The `auth` parameter to Zero can also be a function:

```ts
const zero = new Zero({
  ...,
  auth: async () => {
    const token = await fetchNewToken();
    return token;
  },
  userID,
});
```

In this case, Zero will call this function to get a new JWT if verification fails.

## Permissions

Any data placed into your JWT (claims) can be used by permission rules on the backend.

```ts
const isAdminRule = (decodedJWT, {cmp}) => cmp(decodedJWT.role, '=', 'admin');
```

See the [permissions](permissions) section for more details.
