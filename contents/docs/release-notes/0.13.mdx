## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.13
```

## Features

- Multinode deployment for horizontal scalability and zero-downtime deploys ([docs](/docs/deployment#architecture)).
- SST Deployment Guide ([docs](/docs/deployment#guide-multi-node-on-sstaws)).
- Plain AWS Deployment Guide ([docs](/docs/deployment#guide-multi-node-on-raw-aws)).
- Various exports for external libraries
- Remove build hash from docker version for consistency with npm ([discussion](https://discord.com/channels/830183651022471199/1325165395015110688/1333906735060226161))

## Fixes

- Move heartbeat monitoring to separate path, not port
- Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite ([bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3477)).
- 20x improvement to `whereExists` performance ([discussion](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/3629#issuecomment-2621976119))

## Breaking Changes

- Removing the hash from the version is a breaking change if you had scripts relying on that.
- Moving the heartbeat monitor to a path is a breaking change for deployments that were using that.
