title: Zero 0.12
description: Circular Relationships
---

## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.12
```

## Features

- Schemas now support circular relationships ([docs](/docs/schema#circular-relationships)).
- Added `one()` and `many()` schema helpers to default relationship type ([docs](/docs/schema#table-schemas)).
- Support for syncing tables without a primary key as long as there is a unique index. This enables Prisma's [implicit many-to-many relations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations) ([docs](/docs/postgres-support#primary-keys)).
- Zero has been confirmed to work with Aurora and Google Cloud SQL ([docs](/docs/connecting-to-postgres))
- Client bundle size reduced from 55kb to 47kb (-15%).

## Fixes

- Windows: `zero-cache` was spawning emptying terminals and leaving listeners connected on exit.
- Incorrect warning in `zero-cache` about enums not being supported.
- Failure to handle the primary key of Postgres tables changing.
- Incorrect results when `whereExists()` is before `where()` in query ([bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3417)).
- Error: _The inferred type of '...' cannot be named without a reference to ..._.
- Error: _insufficient upstream connections_.
- Several causes of flicker in React.
- Incorrect values for `ResultType` when unloading and loading a query quickly ([bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3456)).
- Error: _Postgres is missing the column '...' but that column was part of a row_.
- Pointless initial empty render in React when data is already available in memory.
- Error: _Expected string at ... Got array_ during auth.
- `where()` incorrectly allows comparing to `null` with the `=` operator ([bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3426)).
- SolidJS: Only call `setState` once per transaction.

## Breaking Changes

- The schema definition syntax has changed to support circular relationships. See the changes to [`hello-zero`](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/commit/70cd15d5631436c058518d154acb3495b718970e) and [`hello-zero-solid`](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/commit/c8932a7ff06cbdc02759b3b48592ed61055d4cd3) for upgrade examples.
