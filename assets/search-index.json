    "content": "Setting up auth in Zero apps has a few steps: Setting the userID on the client Sending credentials to the mutate and queries endpoints Setting the Context type to implement permissions Logging out if desired Setting userID Because multiple users can share the same browser, Zero requires that you provide a userID parameter on construction: import {ZeroProvider} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' import type {ZeroOptions} from '@rocicorp/zero' const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... userID: 'user-123' } return ( <ZeroProvider {...opts}> <App /> </ZeroProvider> )import {ZeroProvider} from '@rocicorp/zero/solid' import type {ZeroOptions} from '@rocicorp/zero' const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... userID: 'user-123' } return ( <ZeroProvider {...opts}> <App /> </ZeroProvider> )import {Zero} from '@rocicorp/zero' import type {ZeroOptions} from '@rocicorp/zero' const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... userID: 'user-123' } const zero = new Zero(opts) If the user is not logged in, just pass empty string or some other constant value: const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... userID: 'anon' } Zero segregates the client-side storage for each user. This allows users to quickly switch between multiple users and accounts without resyncing. All users that have access to a browser profile have access to the same IndexedDB instances. There is nothing that Zero can do about this – users can just open the folder where the data is stored and look inside it. If you have more than one set of Zero data per-user (i.e., for different apps in the same domain), you can additionally use the storageKey parameter: const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... userID: 'user-123', storageKey: 'my-app' } If specified, storageKey is concatenated along with userID and other internal Zero information to form a unique IndexedDB database name. Sending Credentials You can send credentials using either cookies or tokens. Cookies The most common way to authenticate Zero is with cookies. To enable it, set the ZERO_QUERY_FORWARD_COOKIES and ZERO_MUTATE_FORWARD_COOKIES options to true: export ZERO_QUERY_FORWARD_COOKIES=\"true\" export ZERO_MUTATE_FORWARD_COOKIES=\"true\" # run zero-cache, e.g. `npx zero-cache-dev` Zero-cache will then forward all cookies sent to cacheURL to your mutate and queries endpoints: const opts: ZeroOptions = { schema, // Cookies sent to zero.example.com will be forwarded to // api.example.com/mutate and api.example.com/queries. cacheURL: 'https://zero.example.com', mutateURL: 'https://api.example.com/mutate', queryURL: 'https://api.example.com/queries' } Cookies will show up in the normal HTTP Cookie header and you can authenticate these endpoints just like you would any API request. Deployment In order for cookie auth to work, the browser must send your frontend's cookies to zero-cache, so that zero-cache can forward them to your API. During development, this works automatically as long as your frontend and zero-cache are both running on localhost with different ports. Browsers send cookies based on domain name, not port number, so cookies set by localhost:3000 are also sent to localhost:4848. For production you'll need to do two things: Run zero-cache on a subdomain of your main site (e.g., zero.example.com if your main site is example.com). Consult your hosting provider's docs, or your favorite LLM for how to configure this. Set cookies from your main site with the Domain attribute set to your root domain (e.g., .example.com). If you use a third-party auth provider, consult their docs on how to do this. For example, for Better Auth, this is done with the crossSubDomainCookies feature. Do not set SameSite=None on cookies used for authentication with Zero. Because Zero uses WebSockets, setting SameSite=None can expose your application to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. Use SameSite=Lax (the browser default) or SameSite=Strict instead. Tokens Zero also supports token-based authentication. If you have an opaque auth token, such as a JWT or a token from your auth provider, you can pass it to Zero's auth parameter: const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... auth: token } Zero will forward this token to your mutate and queries endpoints in an Authorization: Bearer <token> header, which you can use to authenticate the request as normal: export async function handleMutate(request: Request) { const session = await authenticate( request.headers.get('Authorization') ) // handle mutate request ... } Auth Failure and Refresh To mark a request as unauthorized, return a 401 or 403 status code from your queries or mutate endpoint. export async function handleMutate(request: Request) { const session = await authenticate( request.headers.get('Authorization') ) if (!session) { // can be 401 or 403 return json({error: 'Unauthorized'}, {status: 401}) } // handle mutate request ... } This will cause Zero to disconnect from zero-cache and the connection status will change to needs-auth. You can then re-authenticate the user and call zero.connection.connect() to reconnect to zero-cache: function NeedsAuthDialog() { const connectionState = useConnectionState() const refreshCookie = async () => { await login() // no token needed since we use cookie auth zero.connection.connect() } if (connectionState.name === 'needs-auth') { return ( <div> <h1>Authentication Required</h1> <button onClick={refreshCookie}>Login</button> </div> ) } return null } Or, if you aren't using cookie auth: function NeedsAuthDialog() { const connectionState = useConnectionState() const refreshAuthToken = async () => { const token = await fetchNewToken() // pass a new token to reconnect to zero-cache zero.connection.connect({auth: token}) } if (connectionState.name === 'needs-auth') { return ( <div> <h1>Authentication Required</h1> <button onClick={refreshAuthToken}>Login</button> </div> ) } return null } Context When a user is authenticated, you will want to know who they are in your queries and mutators to enforce permissions. To do this, define a Context type that includes the user's ID and any other relevant information, then register that type with Zero: export type ZeroContext = { userID: string role: 'admin' | 'user' } declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { context: ZeroContext } } Then pass an instance of this context when instantiating Zero: const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... context: { userID: 'user-123', role: 'admin' } } On the server-side, you will also pass an instance of this context when invoking your queries and mutators: const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) query.fn({args, ctx}) // or const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) mutator.fn({tx, args, ctx}) You can then access the context within your queries and mutators to implement permissions. Permission Patterns Zero does not have (or need) a first-class permission system like RLS. Instead, you implement permissions by authenticating the user in your queries and mutators endpoints, and creating a Context object that contains the user's ID and other information. This context is passed to your queries and mutators and used to control what data the user can access. Here are a collection of common permissions patterns and how to implement them in Zero. Read Permissions Only Owned Rows // Use the context's `userID` to filter the rows to only the // ones owned by the user. const myPosts = defineQuery(({ctx: {userID}}) => { return zql.post.where('authorID', userID) }) Owned or Shared Rows // Use the context's `userID` to filter the rows to only the // ones owned by the user or shared with the user. const allowedPosts = defineQuery(({ctx: {userID}}) => { return zql.post.where(({cmp, exists, or}) => or( cmp('authorID', userID), exists('sharedWith', q => q.where('userID', userID)) ) ) }) Owned Rows or All if Admin const allowedPosts = defineQuery( ({ctx: {userID, role}}) => { if (role === 'admin') { return zql.post } return zql.post.where('authorID', userID) } ) Write Permissions Enforce Ownership // All created items are owned by the user who created them. const createPost = defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string(), content: z.string() }), (tx, {ctx: {userID}, args: {id, title, content}}) => { return zql.post.insert({ id, title, content, authorID: userID }) } ) Edit Owned Rows const updatePost = defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), content: z.string().optional() }), (tx, {ctx: {userID}, args: {id, content}}) => { const prev = await tx.run( zql.post.where('id', id).one() ) if (!prev) { return } if (prev.authorID !== userID) { throw new Error('Access denied') } return zql.post.update({ id, content }) } ) Edit Owned or Shared Rows const updatePost = defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), content: z.string().optional() }), (tx, {ctx: {userID}, args: {id, content}}) => { const prev = await tx.run( zql.post .where('id', id) .related('sharedWith', q => q.where('userID', userID) ) .one() ) if (!prev) { return } if ( prev.authorID !== userID && prev.sharedWith.length === 0 ) { throw new Error('Access denied') } return zql.post.update({ id, content }) } ) Edit Owned or All if Admin const updatePost = defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), content: z.string().optional() }), (tx, {ctx: {role, userID}, args: {id, content}}) => { const prev = await tx.run( zql.post.where('id', id).one() ) if (!prev) { return } if (role !== 'admin' && prev.authorID !== userID) { throw new Error('Access denied') } return zql.post.update({ id, content }) } ) Logging Out When a user logs out, you should consider what should happen to the synced data. If you do nothing, the synced data will be left on the device. The next login will be a little faster because Zero doesn't have to resync that data from scratch. But also, the data will be left on the device indefinitely which could be undesirable for privacy and security. If you instead want to clear data on logout, Zero provides the dropAllDatabases function: import {dropAllDatabases} from '@rocicorp/zero' // Returns an object with: // - The names of the successfully dropped databases // - Any errors encountered while dropping const {dropped, errors} = await dropAllDatabases()",

    "content": "In the future, Zero will work with many different backend databases. Today only Postgres is supported. Specifically, Zero requires Postgres v15.0 or higher, and support for logical replication. Here are some common Postgres options and what we know about their support level: Event Triggers Zero uses Postgres “Event Triggers” when possible to implement high-quality, efficient schema migration. Some hosted Postgres providers don’t provide access to Event Triggers. Zero still works out of the box with these providers, but for correctness, any schema change triggers a full reset of all server-side and client-side state. For small databases (< 10GB) this can be OK, but for bigger databases we recommend choosing a provider that grants access to Event Triggers. Configuration WAL Level The Postgres wal_level config parameter has to be set to logical. You can check what level your pg has with this command: psql -c 'SHOW wal_level' If it doesn’t output logical then you need to change the wal level. To do this, run: psql -c \"ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'logical';\" Then restart Postgres. On most pg systems you can do this like so: data_dir=$(psql -t -A -c 'SHOW data_directory') pg_ctl -D \"$data_dir\" restart After your server restarts, show the wal_level again to ensure it has changed: psql -c 'SHOW wal_level' Bounding WAL Size For development databases, you can set a max_slot_wal_keep_size value in Postgres. This will help limit the amount of WAL kept around. This is a configuration parameter that bounds the amount of WAL kept around for replication slots, and invalidates the slots that are too far behind. zero-cache will automatically detect if the replication slot has been invalidated and re-sync replicas from scratch. This configuration can cause problems like slot has been invalidated because it exceeded the maximum reserved size and is not recommended for production databases. Provider-Specific Notes Google Cloud SQL Zero works with Google Cloud SQL out of the box. In many configurations, when you connect with a user that has sufficient privileges, zero-cache will create its default publication automatically. If your Cloud SQL user does not have permission to create publications, you can still use Zero by creating a publication manually and then specifying that publication name in App Publications when running zero-cache. On Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, enable logical decoding by turning on the instance flag cloudsql.logical_decoding. You do not set wal_level directly on Cloud SQL. See Google's documentation for details: Configure logical replication. Fly.io Fly does not support TLS on their internal networks. If you run both zero-cache and Postgres on Fly, you need to stop zero-cache from trying to use TLS to talk to Postgres. You can do this by adding the sslmode=disable query parameter to your connection strings from zero-cache. Supabase Postgres Version Supabase requires at least 15.8.1.083 for event trigger support. If you have a lower 15.x, Zero will still work but schema updates will be slower. See Supabase's docs for upgrading your Postgres version. Connection Type In order to connect to Supabase you must use the \"Direct Connection\" style connection string, not the pooler: This is because Zero sets up a logical replication slot, which is only supported with a direct connection. IPv4 You may also need to assign an IPv4 address to your Supabase instance: This will be required if you cannot use IPv6 from wherever zero-cache is running. Most cloud providers support IPv6, but some do not. For example, if you are running zero-cache in AWS, it is possible to use IPv6 but difficult. Hetzner offers cheap hosted VPS that supports IPv6. IPv4 addresses are only supported on the Pro plan and are an extra $4/month. PlanetScale for Postgres PlanetScale doesn't support creating publications with the FOR ALL TABLES clause. Zero typically uses this to create an initial default publication during setup. You can workaround this by creating a publication explicitly listing the tables you want to replicate. Neon Neon fully supports Zero, but you should be aware of how Neon's pricing model and Zero interact. Because Zero keeps an open connection to Postgres to replicate changes, as long as zero-cache is running, Postgres will be running and you will be charged by Neon. For production databases that have enough usage to always be running anyway, this is fine. But for smaller applications that would otherwise not always be running, this can create a surprisingly high bill. You may want to choose a provider that charge a flat monthly rate instead. Also some users choose Neon because they hope to use branching for previews. Note that Zero doesn't support this usage model well yet, and if not done with care, Zero can end up keeping each Neon preview branch running too 😳. We are actively working on better preview support.",

But for smaller applications that would otherwise not always be running, this can create a surprisingly high bill. You may want to choose a provider that charge a flat monthly rate instead. Also some users choose Neon because they hope to use branching for previews. Note that Zero doesn't support this usage model well yet, and if not done with care, Zero can end up keeping each Neon preview branch running too 😳. We are actively working on better preview support.",

Once the connection is established, it transitions to connected. While connecting, Zero repeatedly tries to connect to zero-cache for 1 minute by default. This timeout can be configured with the disconnectTimeoutMs constructor parameter: const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... disconnectTimeoutMs: 1000 * 60 * 10 // 10 minutes } Reads and writes are allowed to Zero mutators while connecting. The writes are queued and will be sent when the connection succeeds. This is intended to paper over short connectivity glitches, such as server restarts, walking into an elevator, etc. While you can increase the disconnectTimeoutMs to allow for longer periods of offline operation, this has caveats that you should understand carefully. Please see offline for more information. Disconnecting After the disconnectTimeoutMs elapses, Zero transitions to disconnected. Zero also transitions to disconnected when the tab is hidden for hiddenTabDisconnectDelay (default 5 minutes). While disconnected, Zero continues to try to reconnect to zero-cache every 5 seconds. Reads are allowed while disconnected, but writes are rejected and return an offline error. Errors If zero-cache itself crashes, or if the mutate or query endpoints return a network or HTTP error, Zero transitions to the error state. This type of error is unlikely to resolve just by retrying, so Zero doesn't try. The app can retry the connection manually by calling zero.connection.connect(). Writes are rejected while Zero is in the error state. You can forward connection errors to Sentry (or any error-monitoring tool) by subscribing to zero.connection.state. You can wrap reason in an Error and report it: import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser' zero.connection.state.subscribe(state => { if (state.name !== 'error') return Sentry.withScope(scope => { scope.setTag('zero.connection.state', state.name) scope.setExtra('zero.connection.reason', state.reason) Sentry.captureException( new Error(`Zero connection error: ${state.reason}`) ) }) }) Auth Required If the mutate or query endpoints return a 401 or 403 status code, Zero transitions to the needs-auth state. The app should refresh the cookie or auth token and retry the connection manually by calling zero.connection.connect(). Writes are rejected while Zero is in the needs-auth state. See Authentication for more information. Offline Support While in the connecting state, Zero queues writes and replays them when the connection succeeds. This works well for short periods offline, but not long periods for several reasons. Conflicts Imagine two users are editing an article about cats. One goes offline and does a bunch of work on the article, while the other decides that the article should actually be about dogs and rewrites it. When the offline user reconnects, there is no way that any software algorithm can automatically resolve their conflict. One or the other of them is going to be upset. While this example may sound extreme, you can construct similar situations with the majority of common applications. Just take your own application and ask yourself what should really happen if one user takes their device offline for a week and makes arbitrarily complex changes while other users are working online. If you want to build an application that supports offline writes, you have three options: Make the logical datamodel append-only (i.e., users can create and mark tasks done, but cannot edit or delete them). Support custom UX to allow users to fork and merge conflicts when they occur. Only support editing from a single device. Even a single-user application can experience conflicts as soon as there are multiple devices. Writes Can be Lost Across Schema Changes Typically when a write happens while offline, it is written to local storage and replayed on next connection – even across app restarts. However, if that app restart gets a new version of Zero, or a new schema version, Zero creates a new local storage area and the offline write is effectively lost. In Replicache, our prior sync engine on which Zero is based, this was solved with a system called \"mutation recovery\" that rescued these mutations from prior schema/Zero versions. This system has not yet been ported to Zero. Startup Can be Slow When Replaying Writes When Zero starts, it sends all queued mutations to the server and simultaneously pulls updates from the server. When the server updates are applied, any queued mutations are \"rebased\" (re-run locally) to resolve conflicts. If there are many locally queued changes, this process can be slow. To effectively support long periods offline, Zero should probably have a mode where it first sends all queued mutations, then replays them after the server updates are applied. But this would conflict with the goal to startup and get server updates fast when there aren't many queued mutations, so some work would be needed to balance these two goals. Offline Mutations Must Never Be Rejected When a mutator throws an error on the server, the handleMutateRequest function in @rocicorp/zero/server returns the error to the client but marks the mutation processed. This is a good UX and DX when online because it mirrors the behavior of normal web apps. When offline, mutations should never be rejected. Otherwise the user could lose arbitrarily large amounts of work. Mutations should be replayed until they can be accepted. This would require a different implementation of the handleMutateRequest. Also the developer would have to be very careful to respond to any erroring mutations quickly, as those clients will be unable to save work until the error is resolved.",

    "content": "Zero includes a rich inspector API that can help you understand performance or behavior issues you are seeing in your apps. Accessing the Inspector You access the inspector right from the standard developer console in your browser: For convenience, Zero automatically injects itself as __zero on the global scope of every Zero app. Access to the inspector is gated behind the ZERO_ADMIN_PASSWORD config variable in production (when NODE_ENV is set to \"production\"). We require this variable to be set to a non-empty value in production because we want the inspector enabled in all Zero apps without requiring a restart. Clients and Groups Once you have an inspector, you can inspect the current client and client group. For example to see active queries for the current client: let qs = await inspector.client.queries() console.table(qs) To see active queries for the entire group: let qs = await inspector.client.queries() console.table(qs) In Zero, each instance of the Zero class is a client. Each client belongs to a group, which is a set of clients that share the same clientGroupID (typically all clients within a browser profile). Zero syncs all clients in a group together, so they all see the same data. So if you are debugging performance, you often want to look at the queries for the group, since that is what Zero is actually syncing. But if you are trying to understand when particular queries get added, it's convenient to look at the queries for just the current client so that queries from other clients aren't mixed in. Queries The inspector exposes a bunch of useful information about queries. For example, to see the first query for the current client: let qs = await inspector.client.queries() console.log(qs[0]) This outputs something like: Here are some of the more useful fields: Analyzing Queries Use the analyze method to get information about how a query hydrates: await qs[0].analyze() Here are some of the most useful fields in the output: Analyzing Arbitrary ZQL You can also analyze arbitrary ZQL, not just queries that are currently active: await __zero.inspector.analyzeQuery( __builder.issues.whereExists('labels', q => q.id.equals('sync') ) ) This is useful for exploring alternative query constructions to optimize performance. To use this, you will first have to expose your builder as a property of the global object, so that you can access it from the console. For example: // schema.ts // ... const g = globalThis as any g.__builder = builder Analyzing Query Plans A Zero query is composed of one or more single-table queries connected by joins (related, whereExists). Zero delegates the single-table queries to SQLite, which has a sophisticated query planner that chooses the best indexes to use. For the joins, Zero implements its own cost-based planner to choose the best join order and algorithm. To view the plans selected by SQLite, see the sqlitePlans field returned by analyze() or analyzeQuery(). This contains the output of SQLite's EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN command for each SQLite query used: To view the join plan selected by Zero, call analyze() or analyzeQuery() with the joinPlans option set to true and see the joinPlans field in the output: Table Data In addition to information about queries, you can get direct access to the contents of the client side database. const client = __zero.inspector.client // All raw k/v data currently synced to client console.log('client map:') console.log(await client.map()) // kv table extracted into tables // This is same info that is in z.query[tableName].run() for (const tableName of Object.keys(__zero.schema.tables)) { console.log(`table ${tableName}:`) console.table(await client.rows(tableName)) } Server Version Ask the server to confirm what version it is: console.log( 'server version: ', await inspector.serverVersion() )",

Each client belongs to a group, which is a set of clients that share the same clientGroupID (typically all clients within a browser profile). Zero syncs all clients in a group together, so they all see the same data.

Here are some tips to help debug such slow queries. Query Plan The @rocicorp/zero package ships with a CLI to help debug query plans. You can run it with: # see all parameters npx analyze-query --help # analyze a specific query npx analyze-query \\ --schema-path=\"./schema.ts\" \\ --replica-file=\"./zero.db\" \\ --query='albums.where(\"artistId\", \"artist_1\").orderBy(\"createdAt\", \"asc\").limit(10)' This command will output the query plan and time to execute each phase of that plan: $ npx analyze-query \\ --schema-path=\"./schema.ts\" \\ --replica-file=\"./zero.db\" \\ --query='albums.where(\"artistId\", \"artist_1\").orderBy(\"createdAt\", \"asc\").limit(10)' Loading schema from ./schema.ts === Query Stats: === total synced rows: 10 albums vended: { 'SELECT \"id\",\"title\",\"artist_id\",\"release_year\",\"cover_art_url\",\"created_at\",\"_0_version\" FROM \"albums\" WHERE \"artist_id\" = ? ORDER BY \"created_at\" asc, \"id\" asc': 10 } Rows Read (into JS): 10 time: 3.12ms ms === Rows Scanned (by SQLite): === albums: { 'SELECT \"id\",\"title\",\"artist_id\",\"release_year\",\"cover_art_url\",\"created_at\",\"_0_version\" FROM \"albums\" WHERE \"artist_id\" = ? ORDER BY \"created_at\" asc, \"id\" asc': 25 } total rows scanned: 25 === Query Plans: === query SELECT \"id\",\"title\",\"artist_id\",\"release_year\",\"cover_art_url\",\"created_at\",\"_0_version\" FROM \"albums\" WHERE \"artist_id\" = ? ORDER BY \"created_at\" asc, \"id\" asc SCAN albums USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY Ideally, run this command on the server where your zero.db replica file is located, so it uses the same disk as zero-cache. Adjust the --schema-path to point to your schema file (you may need to copy this onto the server). The --query arg is the ZQL query you want to analyze. Running locally, the analyzer will use any local .env file to find your environment configuration (so you don't need to manually provide the replica file). Optimizing the Plan You should look for any TEMP B-TREE entries in the query plan. These indicate that the query is not properly indexed in SQLite, and that zero-cache had to create a temporary index to satisfy the query. You should add appropriate indexes upstream to fix this. ZQL adds all primary key columns to the orderBy clause for a predictable total order, but only appends those PK columns which are not already present in the order of the query. This means that upstream indexes must also include the PK columns. Feel free to share your query plans with us in Discord if you need help optimizing them. Check ttl If you are seeing unexpected UI flicker when moving between views, it is possible that the queries backing these views have a ttl of never. Set the ttl to something like 5m to keep data cached across navigations. You may alternately want to preload some data at app startup. Conversely, if you are setting ttl to long values, then you may have many backgrounded queries running that the app is not using. You can see which queries are running using the inspector. Ensure that only expected queries are running. Locality If you see log lines like: flushed cvr ... (124ms) this indicates that zero-cache is likely deployed too far away from your CVR database. If you did not configure a CVR database URL then this will be your product's Postgres DB. A slow CVR flush can slow down Zero, since it must complete the flush before sending query result(s) to clients. Try moving zero-cache to be deployed as close as possible to the CVR database. Check Storage zero-cache is effectively a database. It requires fast (low latency and high bandwidth) disk access to perform well. If you're running on network attached storage with high latency, or on AWS with low IOPS, then this is the most likely culprit. Some hosting providers scale IOPS with vCPU. Increasing the vCPU will increase storage throughput and likely resolve the issue. Fly.io provides physically attached SSDs, even for their smallest VMs. Deploying zero-cache there (or any other provider that offers physically attached SSDs) is another option. /statz zero-cache makes some internal health statistics available via the /statz endpoint of zero-cache. In order to access this, you must configure an admin password.",

Here is an example docker-compose.yml file for a single-node deployment (try it out!): services: upstream-db: image: postgres:18 environment: POSTGRES_DB: zero POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass ports: - 5432:5432 command: postgres -c wal_level=logical healthcheck: test: pg_isready interval: 10s your-api: build: ./your-api ports: - 3000:3000 environment: # Your API handles mutations and writes to the PG db # This should be a pooled connection (e.g. pgbouncer) ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB: postgres://postgres:pass@upstream-db:5432/zero depends_on: upstream-db: condition: service_healthy zero-cache: image: rocicorp/zero:{version} ports: - 4848:4848 environment: # Used for replication from postgres # This must be a direct connection (not via pgbouncer) ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB: postgres://postgres:pass@upstream-db:5432/zero # Path to the SQLite replica ZERO_REPLICA_FILE: /data/zero.db # Password used to access the inspector and /statz ZERO_ADMIN_PASSWORD: pickanewpassword # URLs for your API's query and mutate endpoints ZERO_QUERY_URL: http://your-api:3000/api/zero/query ZERO_MUTATE_URL: http://your-api:3000/api/zero/mutate volumes: # Disk for the SQLite replica should be high IOPS - zero-cache-data:/data depends_on: your-api: condition: service_started healthcheck: test: curl -f http://localhost:4848/keepalive interval: 5s Maximal Strategy Once you reach the limits of the single-node deployment, you can split zero-cache into a multi-node topology. This is more expensive to run, but it gives you more flexibility and scalability.

You can also override the number of sync workers per view-syncer with ZERO_NUM_SYNC_WORKERS. Replica Lifecycle Zero-cache is backed by a SQLite replica of your database. The SQLite replica uses upstream Postgres as the source of truth. If the replica is missing or a litestream restore fails, the replication-manager will resync the replica from upstream on the next start. Performance You want to optimize disk IOPS for the serving replica, since this is the file that is read by the view-syncers to run IVM-based queries, and one of the main bottlenecks for query hydration performance. View syncer's IVM is \"hydrate once, then incrementally push diffs\" against the ZQL pipeline, so performance is mostly about: How fast the server can materialize a subscription the first time (hydration). How fast it can keep it up to date (IVM advancement). Different bottlenecks dominate each phase. Hydration SQLite read cost: hydration is essentially \"run the query against the replica and stream all matching rows into the pipeline\", so it's bounded by SQLite scan/index performance + result size. Churn / TTL eviction: if queries get evicted (inactive long enough) and then get re-requested, you pay hydration again. Custom query transform latency: the HTTP request from zero-cache to your API at ZERO_QUERY_URL does transform/authorization for queries, adding network + CPU before hydration starts. IVM advancement Replication throughput: the view-syncer can only advance when the replicator commits and emits version-ready. If upstream replication is behind, query advancement is capped by how fast the replica advances. Change volume per transaction: advancement cost scales with number of changed rows, not number of queries. Circuit breaker behavior: if advancement looks like it'll take longer than rehydrating, zero-cache intentionally aborts and resets pipelines (which trades \"slow incremental\" for \"rehydrate\"). System-level Number of client groups per sync worker: each client group has its own pipelines; CPU and memory per group limits how many can be \"fast\" at once. Since Node is single-threaded, one client group can technically starve other groups. This is handled with time slicing and can be configured with the yield parameters, e.g. ZERO_YIELD_THRESHOLD_MS. SQLite concurrency limits: it's designed here for one writer (replicator) + many concurrent readers (view-syncer snapshots). It scales, but very heavy read workloads can still contend on cache/IO. Network to clients: even if IVM is fast, it can take time to send data over websocket. This can be improved by using CDNs (like CloudFront) that improve routing. Network between services: for a single-region deployment, all services should be colocated. Load Balancing View syncers must be publicly reachable by port 4848 by clients, and the replication-manager can have internal networking with the view-syncers on port 4849. The external load balancer must support websockets, and can use the health check at /keepalive to verify view-syncers and replication-managers are healthy. Sticky Sessions View syncers are designed to be disposable, but since they keep hydrated query pipelines in memory, it's important to try to keep clients connected to the same instance. If a reconnect/refresh lands on a different instance, that instance usually has to rehydrate instead of reusing warm state. If you are seeing a lot of Rehome errors, you may need to enable sticky sessions. Two instances can end up doing redundant hydration/advancement work for the same clientGroupID, and the \"loser\" will eventually force clients to reconnect. Rolling Updates You can roll out updates in the following order: Run additive database migrations (the expand/migrate part of the expand/migrate/contract pattern) and wait for replication to catch up. Upgrade replication-manager. Upgrade view-syncers (if they come up before the replication-manager, they'll sit in retry loops until the manager is updated). The replication-manager requires a full handoff, since it is the single owner of the changelog DB state. The view-syncers are simply drained and reconnected, since they are designed to be disposable. Update the API servers (your mutate and query endpoints). Update client(s). After most clients have refreshed, run contract migrations to drop or rename obsolete columns/tables. Contract migrations are destructive (dropping or renaming columns/tables). Make sure the API and clients are already updated and have had time to refresh before you remove columns. For renames, add the new column, backfill, deploy the app to use it, then drop the old column later. Client/Server Version Compatibility Servers are compatible with any client of same major version, and with clients one major version back. So for example: Server 0.2.* is compatible with client 0.2.* Server 0.2.* is compatible with client 0.1.* Server 2.*.* is compatible with client 2.*.* Server 2.*.* is compatible with client 1.*.* To upgrade Zero to a new major version, first deploy the new zero-cache, then the new frontend. Configuration The zero-cache image is configured via environment variables. See zero-cache Config for available options.",

    "content": "It will be removed in a future release of Zero. See Permissions for more information. Permissions are expressed using ZQL and run automatically with every read and write. Permissions are currently row based. Zero will eventually also have column permissions. Define Permissions Permissions are defined in schema.ts using the definePermissions function. Here's an example of limiting reads to members of an organization and deletes to only the creator of an issue: // The decoded value of your JWT. type AuthData = { // The logged-in user. sub: string } export const permissions = definePermissions< AuthData, Schema >(schema, () => { // Checks if the user exists in a related organization const allowIfInOrganization = ( authData: AuthData, eb: ExpressionBuilder<Schema, 'issue'> ) => eb.exists('organization', q => q.whereExists('user', q => q.where('id', authData.sub) ) ) // Checks if the user is the creator const allowIfIssueCreator = ( authData: AuthData, {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<Schema, 'issue'> ) => cmp('creatorID', authData.sub) return { issue: { row: { select: [allowIfInOrganization], delete: [allowIfIssueCreator] } } } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> }) definePermission returns a policy object for each table in the schema. Each policy defines a ruleset for the operations that are possible on a table: select, insert, update, and delete. Access is Denied by Default If you don't specify any rules for an operation, it is denied by default. This is an important safety feature that helps ensure data isn't accidentally exposed. To enable full access to an action (i.e., during development) use the ANYONE_CAN helper: import {ANYONE_CAN} from '@rocicorp/zero' const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>( schema, () => { return { issue: { row: { select: ANYONE_CAN // Other operations are denied by default. } } // Other tables are denied by default. } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> } ) To do this for all actions, use ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING: import {ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING} from '@rocicorp/zero' const permissions = definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>( schema, () => { return { // All operations on issue are allowed to all users. issue: ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING // Other tables are denied by default. } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> } ) Permission Evaluation Zero permissions are \"compiled\" into a JSON-based format at build-time. This file is stored in the {ZERO_APP_ID}.permissions table of your upstream database. Like other tables, it replicates live down to zero-cache. zero-cache then parses this file, and applies the encoded rules to every read and write operation. The compilation process is very simple-minded (read: dumb). Despite looking like normal TypeScript functions that receive an AuthData parameter, rule functions are not actually invoked at runtime. Instead, they are invoked with a \"placeholder\" AuthData at build time. We track which fields of this placeholder are accessed and construct a ZQL expression that accesses the right field of AuthData at runtime. The end result is that you can't really use most features of JS in these rules. Specifically you cannot: Iterate over properties or array elements in the auth token Use any JS features beyond property access of AuthData Use any conditional or global state Basically only property access is allowed. This is really confusing and we're working on a better solution. Permission Deployment During development, permissions are compiled and uploaded to your database completely automatically as part of the zero-cache-dev script. For production, you need to call npx zero-deploy-permissions within your app to update the permissions in the production database whenever they change. You would typically do this as part of your normal schema migration or CI process. For example, the SST deployment script for zbugs looks like this: new command.local.Command( 'zero-deploy-permissions', { create: `npx zero-deploy-permissions -p ../../src/schema.ts`, // Run the Command on every deploy ... triggers: [Date.now()], environment: { ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB: commonEnv.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB, // If the application has a non-default App ID ... ZERO_APP_ID: commonEnv.ZERO_APP_ID } }, // after the view-syncer is deployed. {dependsOn: viewSyncer} ) See the SST Deployment Guide for more details. Rules Each operation on a policy has a ruleset containing zero or more rules. A rule is just a TypeScript function that receives the logged in user's AuthData and generates a ZQL where expression. At least one rule in a ruleset must return a row for the operation to be allowed. Select Permissions You can limit the data a user can read by specifying a select ruleset. Select permissions act like filters. If a user does not have permission to read a row, it will be filtered out of the result set. It will not generate an error. For example, imagine a select permission that restricts reads to only issues created by the user: definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => { const allowIfIssueCreator = ( authData: AuthData, {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<Schema, 'issue'> ) => cmp('creatorID', authData.sub) return { issue: { row: { select: [allowIfIssueCreator] } } } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> }) If the issue table has two rows, one created by the user and one by someone else, the user will only see the row they created in any queries. Select permission applies to every column. The recommended approach for now is to factor out private fields into a separate table, e.g. user_private. Column permissions are planned but currently not a high priority. Note that although the same limitation applies to declarative insert/update permissions, custom mutators support arbitrary server-side logic and so can easily control which columns are writable. Insert Permissions You can limit what rows can be inserted and by whom by specifying an insert ruleset. Insert rules are evaluated after the entity is inserted. So if they query the database, they will see the inserted row present. If any rule in the insert ruleset returns a row, the insert is allowed. Here's an example of an insert rule that disallows inserting users that have the role 'admin'. definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => { const allowIfNonAdmin = ( authData: AuthData, {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<Schema, 'user'> ) => cmp('role', '!=', 'admin') return { user: { row: { insert: [allowIfNonAdmin] } } } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> }) Update Permissions There are two types of update rulesets: preMutation and postMutation. Both rulesets must pass for an update to be allowed. preMutation rules see the version of a row before the mutation is applied. This is useful for things like checking whether a user owns an entity before editing it. postMutation rules see the version of a row after the mutation is applied. This is useful for things like ensuring a user can only mark themselves as the creator of an entity and not other users. Like other rulesets, preMutation and postMutation default to NOBODY_CAN. This means that every table must define both these rulesets in order for any updates to be allowed. For example, the following ruleset allows an issue's owner to edit, but not re-assign the issue. The postMutation rule enforces that the current user still own the issue after edit. definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => { const allowIfIssueOwner = ( authData: AuthData, {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<Schema, 'issue'> ) => cmp('ownerID', authData.sub) return { issue: { row: { update: { preMutation: [allowIfIssueOwner], postMutation: [allowIfIssueOwner] } } } } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> }) This ruleset allows an issue's owner to edit and re-assign the issue: definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => { const allowIfIssueOwner = ( authData: AuthData, {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<Schema, 'issue'> ) => cmp('ownerID', authData.sub) return { issue: { row: { update: { preMutation: [allowIfIssueOwner], postMutation: ANYONE_CAN } } } } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> }) And this allows anyone to edit an issue, but only if they also assign it to themselves. Useful for enforcing \"patches welcome\"? 🙃 definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => { const allowIfIssueOwner = ( authData: AuthData, {cmp}: ExpressionBuilder<Schema, 'issue'> ) => cmp('ownerID', authData.sub) return { issue: { row: { update: { preMutation: ANYONE_CAN, postMutation: [allowIfIssueOwner] } } } } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> }) Delete Permissions Delete permissions work in the same way as insert permissions except they run before the delete is applied. So if a delete rule queries the database, it will see that the deleted row is present. If any rule in the ruleset returns a row, the delete is allowed. Permissions Based on Auth Data You can use the cmpLit helper to define permissions based on a field of the authData parameter: definePermissions<AuthData, Schema>(schema, () => { const allowIfAdmin = ( authData: AuthData, {cmpLit}: ExpressionBuilder<Schema, 'issue'> ) => cmpLit(authData.role, 'admin') return { issue: { row: { select: [allowIfAdmin] } } } satisfies PermissionsConfig<AuthData, Schema> }) Debugging Given that permissions are defined in their own file and internally applied to queries, it can be hard to figure out if or why a permission check is failing. Read Permissions You can use the analyze-query utility with the --apply-permissions flag to see the complete query Zero runs, including read permissions. npx analyze-query --schema-path='./shared/schema.ts' --query='issue.related(\"comments\")' --apply-permissions --auth-data='{\"userId\":\"user-123\"}' If the result looks right, the problem may be that Zero is not receiving the AuthData that you think it is. You can retrieve a query hash from websocket or server logs, then ask Zero for the details on that specific query. Run this command with the same environment you run zero-cache with. It will use your upstream or cvr configuration to look up the query hash in the cvr database. npx analyze-query --schema-path='./shared/schema.ts' --hash='3rhuw19xt9vry' --apply-permissions --auth-data='{\"userId\":\"user-123\"}' The printed query can be different than the source ZQL string, because it is rebuilt from the query AST. But it should be logically equivalent to the query you wrote. Write Permissions Look for a WARN level log in the output from zero-cache like this: Permission check failed for {\"op\":\"update\",\"tableName\":\"message\",...}, action update, phase preMutation, authData: {...}, rowPolicies: [...], cellPolicies: [] Zero prints the row, auth data, and permission policies that was applied to any failed writes. The ZQL query is printed in AST format. See Query ASTs to convert it to a more readable format.",

    "content": "This guide walks you through adding Zero to any TypeScript-based web app. It should take about 20 minutes to complete. When you're done, you'll have Zero up and running and will understand its core ideas. Integrate Zero Set Up Your Database You'll need a local Postgres database for development. If you don't have a preferred method, we recommend using Docker: docker run -d --name zero-postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"password\" \\ -p 5432:5432 \\ postgres:16-alpine \\ # IMPORTANT: logical WAL level is required for Zero # to sync data to its SQLite replica postgres -c wal_level=logical This will start a Postgres database running in the background. See Connecting to Postgres for more details on what Postgres features are required for Zero to work. Install and Run Zero-Cache Add Zero to your project: npm install @rocicorp/zeropnpm add @rocicorp/zero # Note: pnpm disables postinstall scripts by default for security. # Either approve the build: pnpm approve-builds # Or add to package.json: # \"pnpm\": { # \"onlyBuiltDependencies\": [\"@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3\"] # }bun add @rocicorp/zero # Note: Bun disables postinstall scripts by default for security. # Add to package.json: # \"trustedDependencies\": [\"@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3\"]yarn add @rocicorp/zero Start the development zero-cache by running the following command: export ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" npx zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" pnpm exec zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" bunx zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" yarn exec zero-cache-dev Zero works by continuously replicating your upstream database into a SQLite replica. Zero-cache runs client queries against the replica. If there are tables or columns that will not be queried by Zero clients ever, you can exclude them. You can use the zero-sqlite3 tool to explore zero.db. Try it out by connecting to Postgres and the Zero replica in two different terminals. If you change something in Postgres, you'll see it immediately show up in the replica: Set Up Your Zero Schema Zero uses a file called schema.ts to provide a type-safe query API. If you use Drizzle or Prisma, you can generate schema.ts automatically. Otherwise, you can create it manually. npm install -D drizzle-zero npx drizzle-zero generatepnpm add -D drizzle-zero pnpm dlx drizzle-zero generatebun add -D drizzle-zero bunx drizzle-zero generateyarn add -D drizzle-zero yarn dlx drizzle-zero generatenpm install -D prisma-zero # Add this to your prisma schema: # generator zero { # provider = \"prisma-zero\" # } npx prisma generatepnpm add -D prisma-zero # Add this to your prisma schema: # generator zero { # provider = \"prisma-zero\" # } pnpx prisma generatebun add -D prisma-zero # Add this to your prisma schema: # generator zero { # provider = \"prisma-zero\" # } bunx prisma generateyarn add -D prisma-zero # Add this to your prisma schema: # generator zero { # provider = \"prisma-zero\" # } yarn prisma generate// zero/schema.ts import {table, string, createSchema} from '@rocicorp/zero' const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string() // ... other columns ... }) .primaryKey('id') // ... more tables and relationships ... // See \"Schema\" page in left nav for complete schema API. export const schema = createSchema({ tables: [user] }) // Register the schema for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { schema: typeof schema } } Zero has some restrictions on the Postgres features it supports. You can continue this tutorial with a sample schema and seed data to evaluate it. Set Up the Zero Client Zero has first-class support for React and SolidJS, and community support for Svelte and Vue. There is also a low-level API you can use in any TypeScript-based project. // root.tsx import {ZeroProvider} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' import type {ZeroOptions} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {schema} from './zero/schema.ts' const opts: ZeroOptions = { userID: 'anon', cacheURL: 'http://localhost:4848', schema } function Root() { return ( <ZeroProvider {...opts}> <App /> </ZeroProvider> ) } // mycomponent.tsx import {useZero} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' function MyComponent() { const zero = useZero() console.log('clientID', zero.clientID) }// root.tsx import {ZeroProvider} from '@rocicorp/zero/solid' import type {ZeroOptions} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {schema} from './zero/schema.ts' const opts: ZeroOptions = { userID: 'anon', cacheURL: 'http://localhost:4848', schema } function Root() { return ( <ZeroProvider {...opts}> <App /> </ZeroProvider> ) } // mycomponent.tsx import {useZero} from '@rocicorp/zero/solid' function MyComponent() { const zero = useZero() console.log('clientID', zero().clientID) }// zero.ts import {Zero} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {schema} from './zero/schema.ts' const opts: ZeroOptions = { userID: 'anon', cacheURL: 'http://localhost:4848', schema } const zero = new Zero(opts) console.log('clientID', zero.clientID) export {zero} Sync Data Define Query Alright, let's sync some data! In Zero, we do this with queries. Queries are conventionally found in a queries.ts file. Here is an example of how queries are defined - you can adapt this to your own schema: // zero/queries.ts import {defineQueries, defineQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {z} from 'zod' import {zql} from './schema.ts' export const queries = defineQueries({ albums: { byArtist: defineQuery( z.object({artistID: z.string()}), ({args: {artistID}}) => zql.albums .where('artistId', artistID) .orderBy('createdAt', 'asc') .limit(10) .related('artist', q => q.one()) ) } }) Use zql from schema.ts to construct and return a ZQL query. ZQL is quite powerful and allows you to build queries with filters, sorts, relationships, and more: See queries for more information on defining queries. Invoke Query Querying for data is framework-specific. Most of the time, you will use a helper like useQuery that integrates into your framework's rendering model: // mycomponent.tsx import {useQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' import {queries} from './zero/queries.ts' function MyComponent() { const [albums] = useQuery( queries.albums.byArtist({artistID: 'artist_1'}) ) return albums.map(a => <div key={a.id}>{a.title}</div>) }// mycomponent.tsx import {useQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero/solid' import {queries} from './zero/queries.ts' function MyComponent() { const [albums] = useQuery(() => queries.albums.byArtist({artistID: 'artist_1'}) ) return ( <For each={albums()}> {album => <div key={album.id}>{album.title}</div>} </For> ) }// albums.ts import {zero} from './zero.ts' import {queries} from './zero/queries.ts' const albums = await zero.run( queries.albums.byArtist({artistID: 'artist_1'}) ) console.log('albums', albums) When you reload your app, you should see an error like: > npx zero-cache-dev ... no ZERO_QUERY_URL is configured for Zero Cache> pnpm exec zero-cache-dev ... no ZERO_QUERY_URL is configured for Zero Cache> bunx zero-cache-dev ... no ZERO_QUERY_URL is configured for Zero Cache> yarn exec zero-cache-dev ... no ZERO_QUERY_URL is configured for Zero Cache This is expected. We now need to implement a queries endpoint so that zero-cache can get the ZQL for the albums.byArtist query. Implement Query Backend Zero doesn't allow clients to run any arbitrary ZQL against zero-cache, for both security and performance reasons. Instead, Zero sends the name and arguments of the query to a queries endpoint on your server that is responsible for transforming the named query into ZQL. Zero provides utilities to make it easy to implement the queries endpoint in any full-stack framework: // src/routes/api/query.ts import {createFileRoute} from '@tanstack/react-router' import {handleQueryRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {queries} from '../../zero/queries.ts' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/query')({ server: { handlers: { POST: async ({request}) => { const result = await handleQueryRequest( (name, args) => { const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) return query.fn({args, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }, schema, request ) return Response.json(result) } } } })// app/api/query/route.ts import {handleQueryRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {queries} from '../../zero/queries.ts' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' export async function POST(req: Request) { const result = await handleQueryRequest( (name, args) => { const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) return query.fn({args, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }, schema, req ) return Response.json(result) }// src/routes/api/query.ts import type {APIEvent} from '@solidjs/start/server' import {handleQueryRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {queries} from '../../zero/queries.ts' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' export async function POST(event: APIEvent) { const result = await handleQueryRequest( (name, args) => { const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) return query.fn({args, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }, schema, event.request ) return new Response.json(result) }// api/app.ts import {Hono} from 'hono' import {handleQueryRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {queries} from '../zero/queries.ts' import {schema} from '../zero/schema.ts' const app = new Hono() app.post('/api/query', async c => { const result = await handleQueryRequest( (name, args) => { const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) return query.fn({args, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }, schema, c.req.raw ) return c.json(result) }) Stop and re-run zero-cache with the URL of the queries endpoint: export ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/query\" npx zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/query\" pnpm exec zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/query\" bunx zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/query\" yarn exec zero-cache-dev If you reload the page, you will see data! Zero queries update live, so if you edit data in Postgres directly, you will see it update in the Zero replica AND the UI: More about Queries You now know the basics, but there are a few more important pieces you'll need to learn for your first real app: How authentication and permissions work. Preloading queries to create instantly responsive UI. For these details and more, see Reading Data. But for now, let's move on to writes! Mutate Data Define Mutators Data is written in Zero apps using mutators. Similar to queries, we use a shared mutators.ts file: // zero/mutators.ts import {defineMutators, defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {z} from 'zod' export const mutators = defineMutators({ albums: { create: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), artistID: z.string(), title: z.string(), year: z.number(), createdAt: z.number() }), async ({args, tx}) => { await tx.mutate.albums.insert({ id: args.id, artistId: args.artistID, title: args.title, releaseYear: args.year, createdAt: args.createdAt }) } ) } }) You can use the CRUD-style API with tx.mutate.<table>.<method>() to write data. You can also use tx.run(zql.<table>.<method>) to run queries within your mutator. Mutators almost always run in the same frame on the client, against local data. The reason mutators are marked async is because on the server, reading from the tx object goes over the network to Postgres. Also, in edge cases on the client, reads and writes can go to local storage (IndexedDB or SQLite). Once you've defined your mutators, you must register them with Zero before you can use them: import {mutators} from './zero/mutators.ts' const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... userID, cacheURL, etc. // add mutators mutators } Invoke Mutators You can now call mutators via zero.mutate: // mycomponent.tsx import {useZero} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' import {mutators} from './zero/mutators.ts' import {nanoid} from 'nanoid' function MyComponent() { const zero = useZero() const onClick = async () => { const result = zero.mutate( mutators.albums.create({ id: nanoid(), artistID: 'artist_1', title: 'Please Please Me', year: 1963, createdAt: Date.now() }) ) const clientResult = await result.client if (clientResult.type === 'error') { console.error( 'Failed to create album', clientResult.error.message ) } else { console.log('Album created!') } } return <button onClick={onClick}>Create Album</button> }// mycomponent.tsx import {useZero} from '@rocicorp/zero/solid' import {mutators} from './zero/mutators.ts' import {nanoid} from 'nanoid' function MyComponent() { const zero = useZero() const onClick = async () => { const result = zero().mutate( mutators.albums.create({ id: nanoid(), artistID: 'artist_1', title: 'Please Please Me', year: 1963, createdAt: Date.now() }) ) const clientResult = await result.client if (clientResult.type === 'error') { console.error( 'Failed to create album', clientResult.error.message ) } else { console.log('Album created!') } } return <button onClick={onClick}>Create Album</button> }// albums.ts import {zero} from './zero.ts' import {mutators} from './zero/mutators.ts' import {nanoid} from 'nanoid' const result = await zero.mutate( mutators.albums.create({ id: nanoid(), artistID: 'artist_1', title: 'Please Please Me', year: 1963, createdAt: Date.now() }) ) const clientResult = await result.client if (clientResult.type === 'error') { console.error( 'Failed to create album', clientResult.error.message ) } else { console.log('Album created!') } Client-generated random IDs (from libraries like uuid, ulid, or nanoid) work much better than auto-incrementing integers in sync engines like Zero. Learn more. If you run this app now, you should be able to see the UI update optimistically, but you'll also see an error in zero-cache: > npx zero-cache-dev ... A ZERO_MUTATE_URL must be set in order to process mutations> pnpm exec zero-cache-dev ... A ZERO_MUTATE_URL must be set in order to process mutations> bunx zero-cache-dev ... A ZERO_MUTATE_URL must be set in order to process mutations> yarn exec zero-cache-dev ... A ZERO_MUTATE_URL must be set in order to process mutations Similar to queries, we need to wire up a mutate endpoint in our API. Let's do that now. Implement Mutate Endpoint Zero requires a mutate endpoint which runs on your server and connects directly to your Postgres database. Zero provides helpers to implement this easily. Use the Zero Postgres adapters to create a dbProvider instance: // src/db-provider.ts import {zeroDrizzle} from '@rocicorp/zero/server/adapters/drizzle' import {drizzle} from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres' import {Pool} from 'pg' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' import * as drizzleSchema from '../../drizzle/schema.ts' // pass a drizzle client instance. for example: const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB! }) export const drizzleClient = drizzle(pool, { schema: drizzleSchema }) export const dbProvider = zeroDrizzle(schema, drizzleClient) // Register the database provider for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { dbProvider: typeof dbProvider } }// src/db-provider.ts import {PrismaPg} from '@prisma/adapter-pg' import {PrismaClient} from '@prisma/client' import {zeroPrisma} from '@rocicorp/zero/server/adapters/prisma' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' // pass a prisma client instance. for example: const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter: new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB! }) }) export const dbProvider = zeroPrisma(schema, prisma) // Register the database provider for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { dbProvider: typeof dbProvider } }// src/db-provider.ts import {zeroNodePg} from '@rocicorp/zero/server/adapters/pg' import {Pool} from 'pg' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB! }) export const dbProvider = zeroNodePg(schema, pool) // Register the database provider for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { dbProvider: typeof dbProvider } }// src/db-provider.ts import {zeroPostgresJS} from '@rocicorp/zero/server/adapters/postgresjs' import postgres from 'postgres' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' const sql = postgres(process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB!) export const dbProvider = zeroPostgresJS(schema, sql) // Register the database provider for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { dbProvider: typeof dbProvider } } Then, use the dbProvider to handle the mutate request: // src/routes/api/mutate.ts import {createFileRoute} from '@tanstack/react-router' import {handleMutateRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from '../../zero/mutators.ts' import {dbProvider} from '../../db-provider.ts' export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/mutate')({ server: { handlers: { POST: async ({request}) => { const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({ args, tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'} }) }), request ) return Response.json(result) } } } })// app/api/mutate/route.ts import {handleMutateRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mutators} from '../../zero/mutators.ts' import {dbProvider} from '../../db-provider.ts' import {mustGetMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' export async function POST(req: Request) { const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({args, tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }), req ) return Response.json(result) }// src/routes/api/mutate.ts import type {APIEvent} from '@solidjs/start/server' import {handleMutateRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from '../../zero/mutators.ts' import {dbProvider} from '../../db-provider.ts' export async function POST(event: APIEvent) { const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({args, tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }), event.request ) return new Response.json(result) }// api/app.ts import {handleMutateRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from '../zero/mutators.ts' import {dbProvider} from './db-provider.ts' app.post('/api/mutate', async c => { const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({args, tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }), c.req.raw ) return c.json(result) }) Restart zero-cache to tell it about this new endpoint: export ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/query\" export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/mutate\" npx zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/query\" export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/mutate\" pnpm exec zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/query\" export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/mutate\" bunx zero-cache-devexport ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres\" export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/query\" export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/mutate\" yarn exec zero-cache-dev If you refresh the page, your mutation should commit to the database and sync to other clients: More about Mutators Just as with queries, the separate server implementation of mutators extends elegantly to enable write permissions. Zero also has built-in helpers to do work after a mutator runs on the server, like send notifications. For these details and more, see Writing Data. That's It! Congratulations!

Similar to queries, we use a shared mutators.ts file: // zero/mutators.ts import {defineMutators, defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {z} from 'zod' export const mutators = defineMutators({ albums: { create: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), artistID: z.string(), title: z.string(), year: z.number(), createdAt: z.number() }), async ({args, tx}) => { await tx.mutate.albums.insert({ id: args.id, artistId: args.artistID, title: args.title, releaseYear: args.year, createdAt: args.createdAt }) } ) } }) You can use the CRUD-style API with tx.mutate.<table>.<method>() to write data. You can also use tx.run(zql.<table>.<method>) to run queries within your mutator. Mutators almost always run in the same frame on the client, against local data. The reason mutators are marked async is because on the server, reading from the tx object goes over the network to Postgres. Also, in edge cases on the client, reads and writes can go to local storage (IndexedDB or SQLite). Once you've defined your mutators, you must register them with Zero before you can use them: import {mutators} from './zero/mutators.ts' const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... userID, cacheURL, etc. // add mutators mutators } Invoke Mutators You can now call mutators via zero.mutate: // mycomponent.tsx import {useZero} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' import {mutators} from './zero/mutators.ts' import {nanoid} from 'nanoid' function MyComponent() { const zero = useZero() const onClick = async () => { const result = zero.mutate( mutators.albums.create({ id: nanoid(), artistID: 'artist_1', title: 'Please Please Me', year: 1963, createdAt: Date.now() }) ) const clientResult = await result.client if (clientResult.type === 'error') { console.error( 'Failed to create album', clientResult.error.message ) } else { console.log('Album created!') } } return <button onClick={onClick}>Create Album</button> }// mycomponent.tsx import {useZero} from '@rocicorp/zero/solid' import {mutators} from './zero/mutators.ts' import {nanoid} from 'nanoid' function MyComponent() { const zero = useZero() const onClick = async () => { const result = zero().mutate( mutators.albums.create({ id: nanoid(), artistID: 'artist_1', title: 'Please Please Me', year: 1963, createdAt: Date.now() }) ) const clientResult = await result.client if (clientResult.type === 'error') { console.error( 'Failed to create album', clientResult.error.message ) } else { console.log('Album created!') } } return <button onClick={onClick}>Create Album</button> }// albums.ts import {zero} from './zero.ts' import {mutators} from './zero/mutators.ts' import {nanoid} from 'nanoid' const result = await zero.mutate( mutators.albums.create({ id: nanoid(), artistID: 'artist_1', title: 'Please Please Me', year: 1963, createdAt: Date.now() }) ) const clientResult = await result.client if (clientResult.type === 'error') { console.error( 'Failed to create album', clientResult.error.message ) } else { console.log('Album created!') } Client-generated random IDs (from libraries like uuid, ulid, or nanoid) work much better than auto-incrementing integers in sync engines like Zero.

Reads and writes happen directly against this local datastore, and are synced with the server continuously in the background. Unlike previous sync engines that sync entire tables to the client, or use static rules to control what syncs, you control what to sync in Zero by writing normal queries directly in your application code. This provides a huge amount of control over what data is synced and when. Zero caches query results in a normalized client-side datastore, and reuses that data automatically to answer future queries whenever possible. The result is that for typical applications, queries are almost always instantly resolved using local data. It feels like you have access to the entire backend database directly from the client in memory. Occasionally, when you do a more specific query, Zero falls back to the server.

    "content": "Mutators are how you write data with Zero. Here's a simple example: import {defineMutators, defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {z} from 'zod' export const mutators = defineMutators({ updateIssue: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string() }), async ({tx, args: {id, title}}) => { if (title.length > 100) { throw new Error(`Title is too long`) } await tx.mutate.issue.update({ id, title }) } ) }) Architecture A copy of each mutator exists on both the client and on your server: Often the implementations will be the same, and you can just share their code. This is easy with full-stack frameworks like TanStack Start or Next.js. But the implementations don't have to be the same, or even compute the same result. For example, the server can add extra checks to enforce permissions, or send notifications or interact with other systems. Life of a Mutation When a mutator is invoked, it initially runs on the client, against the client-side datastore. Any changes are immediately applied to open queries and the user sees the changes. In the background, Zero sends a mutation (a record of the mutator having run with certain arguments) to your server's push endpoint. Your push endpoint runs the push protocol, executing the server-side mutator in a transaction against your database and recording the fact that the mutation ran. The @rocicorp/zero package contains utilities to make it easy to implement this endpoint in TypeScript. The changes to the database are then replicated to zero-cache using logical replication. zero-cache calculates the updates to active queries and sends rows that have changed to each client. It also sends information about the mutations that have been applied to the database. Clients receive row updates and apply them to their local cache. Any pending mutations which have been applied to the server have their local effects rolled back. Client-side queries are updated and the user sees the changes. Defining Mutators Basics Create a mutator using defineMutator. The only required argument is a MutatorFn, which must be async: import {defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' const myMutator = defineMutator(async () => { // ... }) Mutators almost always complete in the same frame on the client, within milliseconds. The reason they are marked async is because on the server, reading from the tx object goes over the network to Postgres. Writing Data The MutatorFn receives a tx parameter which can be used to write data with a CRUD-style API. Each table in your Zero schema has a corresponding field on tx.mutate: const myMutator = defineMutator(async ({tx}) => { // This is here because there's a `user` table in your schema. await tx.mutate.user.insert(...) }) Failing to do so allows the transaction to commit early, causing runtime errors when writes are attempted later. Insert Create new records with insert: tx.mutate.user.insert({ id: 'user-123', username: 'sam', language: 'js' }) Optional fields can be set to null to explicitly set the new field to null. They can also be set to undefined to take the default value (which is often null but can also be some generated value server-side): // Sets language to `null` specifically tx.mutate.user.insert({ id: 'user-123', username: 'sam', language: null }) // Sets language to the default server-side value. // Could be null, or some generated or constant default value too. tx.mutate.user.insert({ id: 'user-123', username: 'sam' }) // Same as above tx.mutate.user.insert({ id: 'user-123', username: 'sam', language: undefined }) Upsert Create new records or update existing ones with upsert: tx.mutate.user.upsert({ id: samID, username: 'sam', language: 'ts' }) upsert supports the same null / undefined semantics for optional fields that insert does (see above). Update Update an existing record. Does nothing if the specified record (by PK) does not exist. You can pass a partial object, leaving fields out that you don’t want to change. For example here we leave the username the same: // Leaves username field to previous value. tx.mutate.user.update({ id: samID, language: 'golang' }) // Same as above tx.mutate.user.update({ id: samID, username: undefined, language: 'haskell' }) // Reset language field to `null` tx.mutate.user.update({ id: samID, language: null }) Delete Delete an existing record. Does nothing if specified record does not exist. tx.mutate.user.delete({ id: samID }) Arguments The MutatorFn can take a single args parameter. To enable this, pass a validator to defineMutator: import {defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' const initStats = defineMutator( z.object({issueCount: z.number()}), async ({ tx, args: {issueCount} }) => { if (issueCount < 0) { throw new Error(`issueCount cannot be negative`) } await tx.mutate.stats.insert({ id: 'global', issueCount }) } ) We use Zod in these examples, but you can use any validation library that implements Standard Schema. It's most common for mutators to be a pure function of the database state plus arguments. But it's not required. Impure mutators can be useful, e.g., to consult some external system on the server for authorization or validation. Reading Data You can read data within a mutator by passing ZQL to tx.run: const updateIssue = defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), title: z.string()}), async ({tx, args: {id, title}}) => { const issue = await tx.run( zql.issue.where('id', id).one() ) if (issue?.status === 'closed') { throw new Error(`Cannot update closed issue`) } await tx.mutate.issue.update({ id, title }) } ) You have the full power of ZQL at your disposal, including relationships, filters, ordering, and limits. Reads and writes within a mutator are transactional, meaning that the datastore is guaranteed to not change while your mutator is running. And if the mutator throws, the entire mutation is rolled back. Unlike zero.run(), there is no type parameter that can be used to wait for server results inside mutators. This is because waiting for server results in mutators makes no sense – it would defeat the purpose of running optimistically to begin with. When a mutator runs on the client (tx.location === \"client\"), ZQL reads only return data already cached on the client. When mutators run on the server (tx.location === \"server\"), ZQL reads always return all data. Context Mutator parameters are supplied by the client application and passed to the server automatically by Zero. This makes them unsuitable for credentials, since the user could modify them. For this reason, Zero mutators also support the concept of a context object. Access your context with the ctx parameter to your mutator: const createIssue = defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), title: z.string()}), async ({tx, ctx: {userID}, args: {id, title}}) => { // Note: User cannot control ctx.userID, so this // enforces authorship of created issue. await tx.mutate.issue.insert({ id, title, authorID: userID }) } ) Mutator Registries The result of defineMutator is a MutatorDefinition. By itself this isn't super useful. You need to register it using defineMutators: export const mutators = defineMutators({ issue: { update: updateIssue } }) Typically these are done together in one step: export const mutators = defineMutators({ issue: { update: defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), title: z.string()}), async ({tx, args: {id, title}}) => { await tx.mutate.issue.update({ id, title }) } ) } }) The result of defineMutators is called a MutatorRegistry. Each field in the registry is a callable Mutator that you can use to perform mutations: import {mutators} from 'mutators.ts' zero.mutate( mutators.issue.update({ id: 'issue-123', title: 'New title' }) ) Mutator Names Each Mutator has a mutatorName which is computed by defineMutators. When you run a mutator, Zero sends this name along with the arguments to your server to execute the server-side mutation. console.log(mutators.issue.update.mutatorName) // \"issue.update\" mutators.ts By convention, mutators are listed in a central mutators.ts file. This allows them to be easily used on both the client and server: import {defineMutators, defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {zql} from './schema.ts' import {z} from 'zod' export const mutators = defineMutators({ posts: { create: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string() }), async ({ tx, context: {userID}, args: {id, title} }) => { await tx.mutate.post.insert({ id, title, authorID: userID }) } ), update: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string().optional() }), async ({ tx, context: {userID}, args: {id, title} }) => { const prev = await tx.run( zql.post.where('id', id).one() ) if (prev?.authorID !== userID) { throw new Error(`Access denied`) } await tx.mutate.post.update({ id, title, authorID: userID }) } ) } }) You can use as many levels of nesting as you want to organize your mutators. As your application grows, you can move mutators to different files to keep them organized: // posts.ts export const postMutators = { create: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string(), }), async ({tx, context: {userID}, args: {id, title}}) => { await tx.mutate.post.insert({ id, title, authorID: userID, }) }, ), } // user.ts export const userMutators = { updateRole: defineMutator( z.object({ role: z.string(), }), async ({tx, ctx: {userID}, args: {role}}) => { await tx.mutate.user.update({ id: userID, role, }) }, ), } // mutators.ts import {postMutators} from 'zero/mutators/posts.ts' import {userMutators} from 'zero/mutators/users.ts' export const mutators = defineMutators{{ posts: postMutators, users: userMutators, }) defineMutators establishes the full name for each mutator (i.e., posts.create, users.updateRole), which is later sent to the server. So this should only be used once at the top level of your mutators.ts file. Registration Before you can use your mutators, you need to register them with Zero: import {ZeroProvider} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' import type {ZeroOptions} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from 'zero/mutators.ts' const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... cacheURL, schema, etc. mutators } return ( <ZeroProvider {...opts}> <App /> </ZeroProvider> )import {ZeroProvider} from '@rocicorp/zero/solid' import type {ZeroOptions} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from 'zero/mutators.ts' const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... cacheURL, schema, etc. mutators } return ( <ZeroProvider {...opts}> <App /> </ZeroProvider> )import {Zero} from '@rocicorp/zero' import type {ZeroOptions} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from 'zero/mutators.ts' const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... cacheURL, schema, etc. mutators } const zero = new Zero(opts) Mutators need to be registered with Zero because Zero calls them during sync for conflict resolution. If you invoke a mutator that is not registered, Zero will throw an error. Server Setup In order for mutations to sync, you must provide an implementation of the mutate endpoint on your server. zero-cache calls this endpoint to process each mutation. Registering the Endpoint Use ZERO_MUTATE_URL to tell zero-cache where to find your mutate implementation: export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/zero/mutate\" # run zero-cache, e.g. `npx zero-cache-dev` Implementing the Endpoint You can use the handleMutateRequest and mustGetMutator functions to implement the endpoint. Plug in whatever dbProvider you set up (see server-zql or the install guide). // src/routes/api/zero/mutate.ts import {createFileRoute} from '@tanstack/react-router' import {handleMutateRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from 'mutators.ts' import {dbProvider} from 'db-provider.ts' export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/zero/mutate')({ server: { handlers: { POST: async ({request}) => { const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({ args, tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'} }) }), request ) return Response.json(result) } } } })// app/api/zero/mutate/route.ts import {handleMutateRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from 'mutators.ts' import {dbProvider} from 'db-provider.ts' export async function POST(req: Request) { const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({args, tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }), req ) return Response.json(result) }// src/routes/api/zero/mutate.ts import type {APIEvent} from '@solidjs/start/server' import {handleMutateRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from 'mutators.ts' import {dbProvider} from 'db-provider.ts' export async function POST(event: APIEvent) { const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({args, tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }), event.request ) return new Response.json(result) }// api/app.ts import {Hono} from 'hono' import {handleMutateRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {mutators} from 'mutators.ts' import {dbProvider} from './db-provider.ts' const app = new Hono() app.post('/api/zero/mutate', async c => { const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({ args, tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'} }) }), c.req.raw ) return c.json(result) }) Zero includes several built-in database adapters. You can also easily create your own. See ZQL on the Server for more information. handleMutateRequest accepts a standard Request and returns a JSON object which can be serialized and returned by your server framework of choice. mustGetMutator looks up the mutator in the registry and throws an error if not found. The mutator.fn function is your mutator implementation wrapped in the validator you provided. Handling Errors The handleMutateRequest function skips any mutations that throw: const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact(async (tx, name, args) => { // The mutation is skipped and the next mutation runs as normal. // The optimistic mutation on the client will be reverted. throw new Error('bonk') }), c.req.raw ) handleMutateRequest catches such errors and turns them into a structured response that gets sent back to the client. You can recover the errors and show UI if you want. It is also of course possible for the entire push endpoint to return an HTTP error, or to not reply at all: export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/zero/mutate')({ server: { handlers: { POST: async () => { throw new Error('zonk') // will trigger resend } } } })export async function POST() { throw new Error('zonk') // will trigger resend }export async function POST() { throw new Error('zonk') // will trigger resend }app.post('/api/zero/mutate', async c => { // This will cause the client to resend all queued mutations. throw new Error('zonk') }) If Zero receives any response from the mutate endpoint other than HTTP 200, 401, or 403, it will disconnect and enter the error state. If Zero receives HTTP 401 or 403, the client will enter the needs auth state and require a manual reconnect with zero.connection.connect(), then it will retry all queued mutations. If you want a different behavior, it is possible to implement the mutate endpoint yourself and handle errors differently. Custom Mutate URL By default, Zero sends mutations to the URL specified in the ZERO_MUTATE_URL parameter. However you can customize this on a per-client basis. To do so, list multiple comma-separated URLs in the ZERO_MUTATE_URL parameter: export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"https://api.example.com/mutate,https://api.staging.example.com/mutate\" Then choose one of those URLs by passing it to mutateURL on the Zero constructor: const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... mutateURL: 'https://api.staging.example.com/mutate' } URL Patterns The strings listed in ZERO_MUTATE_URL can also be URLPatterns: export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"https://mybranch-*.preview.myapp.com/mutate\" For more information, see the URLPattern section of the Queries docs. It works the same way for mutations. Server-Specific Code To implement server-specific code, just run different mutators in your mutate endpoint. Server authority to the rescue! defineMutators accepts a baseMutators parameter that makes this easy. The returned mutator registry will contain all the mutators from baseMutators, plus any new ones you define or override: // server-mutators.ts import {defineMutators, defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {z} from 'zod' import {zql} from 'schema.ts' import {mutators as sharedMutators} from 'mutators.ts' export const serverMutators = defineMutators( sharedMutators, { posts: { // Overrides the shared mutator definition with same name. update: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string().optional(), priority: z.number().optional() }), async ({ tx, ctx: {userID}, args: {id, title, priority} }) => { // Run the shared mutator first. await sharedMutators.posts.update.fn({ tx, ctx, args }) // Record a history of this operation happening in an audit log table. await tx.mutate.auditLog.insert({ issueId: id, action: 'update-title', timestamp: Date.getTime() }) } ) } } ) For simple things, we also expose a location field on the transaction object that you can use to branch your code: const myMutator = defineMutator(async ({tx}) => { if (tx.location === 'client') { // Client-side code } else { // Server-side code } }) Running Mutators Once you have registered your mutators, you can invoke them with zero.mutate: import {mutators} from 'mutators.ts' import {nanoid} from 'nanoid' zero.mutate( mutators.issue.update({ id: nanoid(), title: 'New title' }) ) Client-generated random IDs from libraries like uuid, ulid, or nanoid work much better with sync engines like Zero. See IDs for more details. Waiting for Results We typically recommend that you \"fire and forget\" mutators. Optimistic mutations make sense when the common case is that a mutation succeeds. If a mutation frequently fails, then showing the user an optimistic result isn't very useful, because it will likely be wrong. That said there are cases where it is nice to know when a write succeeded on either the client or server. One example is if you need to read a row directly after writing it. Zero's local writes are very fast (almost always < 1 frame), but because Zero is backed by IndexedDB, writes are still technically asynchronous and reads directly after a write may not return the new data. You can use the .client promise in this case to wait for a write to complete on the client side: const write = zero.mutate( mutators.issue.insert({ id: nanoid(), title: 'New title' }) ) // issue-123 not guaranteed to be present here. read1 may be undefined. const read1 = await zero.run( queries.issue.byId('issue-123').one() ) // Await client write – almost always less than 1 frame, and same // macrotask, so no browser paint will occur here. const res = await write.client if (res.type === 'error') { console.error('Mutator failed on client', res.error) } // issue-123 definitely can be read now. const read2 = await zero.run( queries.issue.byId('issue-123').one() ) You can also wait for the server write to succeed: const write = zero.mutate( mutators.issue.insert({ id: nanoid(), title: 'New title' }) ) const clientRes = await write.client if (clientRes.type === 'error') { throw new Error( `Mutator failed on client`, clientRes.error ) } // optimistic write guaranteed to be present here, but not // server write. const read1 = await zero.run( queries.issue.byId('issue-123').one() ) // Await server write – this involves a round-trip. const serverRes = await write.server if (serverRes.type === 'error') { throw new Error( `Mutator failed on server`, serverRes.error ) } // issue-123 is written to server and any results are // synced to this client. // read2 could potentially be undefined here, for example if the // server mutator rejected the write. const read2 = await zero.run( queries.issue.byId('issue-123').one() ) If the client-side mutator fails, the .server promise is also rejected with the same error. You don't have to listen to both promises, the server promise covers both cases. There is not yet a way to return data from mutators in the success case. Let us know if you need this. Permissions Because mutators are just normal TypeScript functions that run server-side, there is no need for a special permissions system. You can implement whatever permission checks you want using plain TypeScript code. See Permissions for more information. Dropping Down to Raw SQL The ServerTransaction interface has a dbTransaction property that exposes the underlying database connection. This allows you to run raw SQL queries directly against the database. This is useful for complex queries, or for using Postgres features that Zero doesn't support yet: const markAllAsRead = defineMutator( z.object({ userId: z.string() }), async ({tx, args: {userId}}) => { // shared stuff ... if (tx.location === 'server') { // `tx` is now narrowed to `ServerTransaction`. // Do special server-only stuff with raw SQL. await tx.dbTransaction.query( ` UPDATE notification SET read = true WHERE user_id = $1 `, [userId] ) } } ) See ZQL on the Server for more information. Notifications and Async Work The best way to handle notifications and async work is a transactional outbox. This ensures that notifications actually do eventually get sent, without holding open database transactions to talk over the network. This can be implemented very easily in Zero by writing notifications to an outbox table as part of your mutator, then processing that table periodically with a background job. However sometimes it's still nice to do a quick and dirty async send as part of a mutation, for example early on in development, or to record metrics. For this, the createMutators pattern is useful: // server-mutators.ts import {defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import z from 'zod' import {zql} from 'schema.ts' import {mutators as clientMutators} from 'mutators.ts' // Instead of defining server mutators as a constant, // define them as a function of a list of async tasks. export function createMutators( asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> ) { return defineMutators(clientMutators, { issue: { update: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string() }), async (tx, {id, title}) => { await tx.mutate.issue.update({id, title}) asyncTasks.push(() => sendEmailToSubscribers(id)) } ) } }) } Then in your mutate handler: export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/zero/mutate')({ server: { handlers: { POST: async ({request}) => { const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [] const mutators = createMutators(asyncTasks) const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({ tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}, args }) }), request ) // Run all async tasks // If any fail, do not block the response, since the // mutation result has already been written to the database. await Promise.allSettled( asyncTasks.map(task => task()) ) return json(result) } } } })export async function POST(req: Request) { const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [] const mutators = createMutators(asyncTasks) const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}, args}) }), req ) // Run all async tasks // If any fail, do not block the response, since the // mutation result has already been written to the database. await Promise.allSettled(asyncTasks.map(task => task())) return Response.json(result) }export async function POST(event: APIEvent) { const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [] const mutators = createMutators(asyncTasks) const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}, args}) }), event.request ) // Run all async tasks // If any fail, do not block the response, since the // mutation result has already been written to the database. await Promise.allSettled(asyncTasks.map(task => task())) return new Response.json(result) }app.post('/api/zero/mutate', async c => { const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [] const mutators = createMutators(asyncTasks) const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({ tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}, args }) }), c.req.raw ) // Run all async tasks // If any fail, do not block the response, since the // mutation result has already been written to the database. await Promise.allSettled(asyncTasks.map(task => task())) return c.json(result) }) Custom Mutate Implementation You can manually implement the mutate endpoint in any programming language. This will be documented in the future, but you can refer to the handleMutateRequest source code for an example for now.",

For example, the server can add extra checks to enforce permissions, or send notifications or interact with other systems.

    "content": "Basics Create a mutator using defineMutator. The only required argument is a MutatorFn, which must be async: import {defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' const myMutator = defineMutator(async () => { // ... }) Mutators almost always complete in the same frame on the client, within milliseconds. The reason they are marked async is because on the server, reading from the tx object goes over the network to Postgres. Writing Data The MutatorFn receives a tx parameter which can be used to write data with a CRUD-style API. Each table in your Zero schema has a corresponding field on tx.mutate: const myMutator = defineMutator(async ({tx}) => { // This is here because there's a `user` table in your schema. await tx.mutate.user.insert(...) }) Failing to do so allows the transaction to commit early, causing runtime errors when writes are attempted later. Insert Create new records with insert: tx.mutate.user.insert({ id: 'user-123', username: 'sam', language: 'js' }) Optional fields can be set to null to explicitly set the new field to null. They can also be set to undefined to take the default value (which is often null but can also be some generated value server-side): // Sets language to `null` specifically tx.mutate.user.insert({ id: 'user-123', username: 'sam', language: null }) // Sets language to the default server-side value. // Could be null, or some generated or constant default value too. tx.mutate.user.insert({ id: 'user-123', username: 'sam' }) // Same as above tx.mutate.user.insert({ id: 'user-123', username: 'sam', language: undefined }) Upsert Create new records or update existing ones with upsert: tx.mutate.user.upsert({ id: samID, username: 'sam', language: 'ts' }) upsert supports the same null / undefined semantics for optional fields that insert does (see above). Update Update an existing record. Does nothing if the specified record (by PK) does not exist. You can pass a partial object, leaving fields out that you don’t want to change. For example here we leave the username the same: // Leaves username field to previous value. tx.mutate.user.update({ id: samID, language: 'golang' }) // Same as above tx.mutate.user.update({ id: samID, username: undefined, language: 'haskell' }) // Reset language field to `null` tx.mutate.user.update({ id: samID, language: null }) Delete Delete an existing record. Does nothing if specified record does not exist. tx.mutate.user.delete({ id: samID }) Arguments The MutatorFn can take a single args parameter. To enable this, pass a validator to defineMutator: import {defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' const initStats = defineMutator( z.object({issueCount: z.number()}), async ({ tx, args: {issueCount} }) => { if (issueCount < 0) { throw new Error(`issueCount cannot be negative`) } await tx.mutate.stats.insert({ id: 'global', issueCount }) } ) We use Zod in these examples, but you can use any validation library that implements Standard Schema. It's most common for mutators to be a pure function of the database state plus arguments. But it's not required. Impure mutators can be useful, e.g., to consult some external system on the server for authorization or validation. Reading Data You can read data within a mutator by passing ZQL to tx.run: const updateIssue = defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), title: z.string()}), async ({tx, args: {id, title}}) => { const issue = await tx.run( zql.issue.where('id', id).one() ) if (issue?.status === 'closed') { throw new Error(`Cannot update closed issue`) } await tx.mutate.issue.update({ id, title }) } ) You have the full power of ZQL at your disposal, including relationships, filters, ordering, and limits. Reads and writes within a mutator are transactional, meaning that the datastore is guaranteed to not change while your mutator is running. And if the mutator throws, the entire mutation is rolled back. Unlike zero.run(), there is no type parameter that can be used to wait for server results inside mutators. This is because waiting for server results in mutators makes no sense – it would defeat the purpose of running optimistically to begin with. When a mutator runs on the client (tx.location === \"client\"), ZQL reads only return data already cached on the client. When mutators run on the server (tx.location === \"server\"), ZQL reads always return all data. Context Mutator parameters are supplied by the client application and passed to the server automatically by Zero. This makes them unsuitable for credentials, since the user could modify them. For this reason, Zero mutators also support the concept of a context object. Access your context with the ctx parameter to your mutator: const createIssue = defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), title: z.string()}), async ({tx, ctx: {userID}, args: {id, title}}) => { // Note: User cannot control ctx.userID, so this // enforces authorship of created issue. await tx.mutate.issue.insert({ id, title, authorID: userID }) } ) Mutator Registries The result of defineMutator is a MutatorDefinition. By itself this isn't super useful. You need to register it using defineMutators: export const mutators = defineMutators({ issue: { update: updateIssue } }) Typically these are done together in one step: export const mutators = defineMutators({ issue: { update: defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), title: z.string()}), async ({tx, args: {id, title}}) => { await tx.mutate.issue.update({ id, title }) } ) } }) The result of defineMutators is called a MutatorRegistry. Each field in the registry is a callable Mutator that you can use to perform mutations: import {mutators} from 'mutators.ts' zero.mutate( mutators.issue.update({ id: 'issue-123', title: 'New title' }) ) Mutator Names Each Mutator has a mutatorName which is computed by defineMutators. When you run a mutator, Zero sends this name along with the arguments to your server to execute the server-side mutation. console.log(mutators.issue.update.mutatorName) // \"issue.update\" mutators.ts By convention, mutators are listed in a central mutators.ts file. This allows them to be easily used on both the client and server: import {defineMutators, defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {zql} from './schema.ts' import {z} from 'zod' export const mutators = defineMutators({ posts: { create: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string() }), async ({ tx, context: {userID}, args: {id, title} }) => { await tx.mutate.post.insert({ id, title, authorID: userID }) } ), update: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string().optional() }), async ({ tx, context: {userID}, args: {id, title} }) => { const prev = await tx.run( zql.post.where('id', id).one() ) if (prev?.authorID !== userID) { throw new Error(`Access denied`) } await tx.mutate.post.update({ id, title, authorID: userID }) } ) } }) You can use as many levels of nesting as you want to organize your mutators. As your application grows, you can move mutators to different files to keep them organized: // posts.ts export const postMutators = { create: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string(), }), async ({tx, context: {userID}, args: {id, title}}) => { await tx.mutate.post.insert({ id, title, authorID: userID, }) }, ), } // user.ts export const userMutators = { updateRole: defineMutator( z.object({ role: z.string(), }), async ({tx, ctx: {userID}, args: {role}}) => { await tx.mutate.user.update({ id: userID, role, }) }, ), } // mutators.ts import {postMutators} from 'zero/mutators/posts.ts' import {userMutators} from 'zero/mutators/users.ts' export const mutators = defineMutators{{ posts: postMutators, users: userMutators, }) defineMutators establishes the full name for each mutator (i.e., posts.create, users.updateRole), which is later sent to the server.

Reads and writes within a mutator are transactional, meaning that the datastore is guaranteed to not change while your mutator is running. And if the mutator throws, the entire mutation is rolled back. Unlike zero.run(), there is no type parameter that can be used to wait for server results inside mutators.

You can also easily create your own. See ZQL on the Server for more information. handleMutateRequest accepts a standard Request and returns a JSON object which can be serialized and returned by your server framework of choice. mustGetMutator looks up the mutator in the registry and throws an error if not found.

Handling Errors The handleMutateRequest function skips any mutations that throw: const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact(async (tx, name, args) => { // The mutation is skipped and the next mutation runs as normal. // The optimistic mutation on the client will be reverted. throw new Error('bonk') }), c.req.raw ) handleMutateRequest catches such errors and turns them into a structured response that gets sent back to the client. You can recover the errors and show UI if you want. It is also of course possible for the entire push endpoint to return an HTTP error, or to not reply at all: export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/zero/mutate')({ server: { handlers: { POST: async () => { throw new Error('zonk') // will trigger resend } } } })export async function POST() { throw new Error('zonk') // will trigger resend }export async function POST() { throw new Error('zonk') // will trigger resend }app.post('/api/zero/mutate', async c => { // This will cause the client to resend all queued mutations. throw new Error('zonk') }) If Zero receives any response from the mutate endpoint other than HTTP 200, 401, or 403, it will disconnect and enter the error state. If Zero receives HTTP 401 or 403, the client will enter the needs auth state and require a manual reconnect with zero.connection.connect(), then it will retry all queued mutations. If you want a different behavior, it is possible to implement the mutate endpoint yourself and handle errors differently. Custom Mutate URL By default, Zero sends mutations to the URL specified in the ZERO_MUTATE_URL parameter. However you can customize this on a per-client basis. To do so, list multiple comma-separated URLs in the ZERO_MUTATE_URL parameter: export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"https://api.example.com/mutate,https://api.staging.example.com/mutate\" Then choose one of those URLs by passing it to mutateURL on the Zero constructor: const opts: ZeroOptions = { // ... mutateURL: 'https://api.staging.example.com/mutate' } URL Patterns The strings listed in ZERO_MUTATE_URL can also be URLPatterns: export ZERO_MUTATE_URL=\"https://mybranch-*.preview.myapp.com/mutate\" For more information, see the URLPattern section of the Queries docs. It works the same way for mutations. Server-Specific Code To implement server-specific code, just run different mutators in your mutate endpoint. Server authority to the rescue! defineMutators accepts a baseMutators parameter that makes this easy. The returned mutator registry will contain all the mutators from baseMutators, plus any new ones you define or override: // server-mutators.ts import {defineMutators, defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {z} from 'zod' import {zql} from 'schema.ts' import {mutators as sharedMutators} from 'mutators.ts' export const serverMutators = defineMutators( sharedMutators, { posts: { // Overrides the shared mutator definition with same name. update: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string().optional(), priority: z.number().optional() }), async ({ tx, ctx: {userID}, args: {id, title, priority} }) => { // Run the shared mutator first. await sharedMutators.posts.update.fn({ tx, ctx, args }) // Record a history of this operation happening in an audit log table. await tx.mutate.auditLog.insert({ issueId: id, action: 'update-title', timestamp: Date.getTime() }) } ) } } ) For simple things, we also expose a location field on the transaction object that you can use to branch your code: const myMutator = defineMutator(async ({tx}) => { if (tx.location === 'client') { // Client-side code } else { // Server-side code } })",

    "content": "The best way to handle notifications and async work is a transactional outbox. This ensures that notifications actually do eventually get sent, without holding open database transactions to talk over the network. This can be implemented very easily in Zero by writing notifications to an outbox table as part of your mutator, then processing that table periodically with a background job. However sometimes it's still nice to do a quick and dirty async send as part of a mutation, for example early on in development, or to record metrics. For this, the createMutators pattern is useful: // server-mutators.ts import {defineMutator} from '@rocicorp/zero' import z from 'zod' import {zql} from 'schema.ts' import {mutators as clientMutators} from 'mutators.ts' // Instead of defining server mutators as a constant, // define them as a function of a list of async tasks. export function createMutators( asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> ) { return defineMutators(clientMutators, { issue: { update: defineMutator( z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string() }), async (tx, {id, title}) => { await tx.mutate.issue.update({id, title}) asyncTasks.push(() => sendEmailToSubscribers(id)) } ) } }) } Then in your mutate handler: export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/zero/mutate')({ server: { handlers: { POST: async ({request}) => { const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [] const mutators = createMutators(asyncTasks) const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({ tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}, args }) }), request ) // Run all async tasks // If any fail, do not block the response, since the // mutation result has already been written to the database. await Promise.allSettled( asyncTasks.map(task => task()) ) return json(result) } } } })export async function POST(req: Request) { const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [] const mutators = createMutators(asyncTasks) const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}, args}) }), req ) // Run all async tasks // If any fail, do not block the response, since the // mutation result has already been written to the database. await Promise.allSettled(asyncTasks.map(task => task())) return Response.json(result) }export async function POST(event: APIEvent) { const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [] const mutators = createMutators(asyncTasks) const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}, args}) }), event.request ) // Run all async tasks // If any fail, do not block the response, since the // mutation result has already been written to the database. await Promise.allSettled(asyncTasks.map(task => task())) return new Response.json(result) }app.post('/api/zero/mutate', async c => { const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [] const mutators = createMutators(asyncTasks) const result = await handleMutateRequest( dbProvider, transact => transact((tx, name, args) => { const mutator = mustGetMutator(mutators, name) return mutator.fn({ tx, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}, args }) }), c.req.raw ) // Run all async tasks // If any fail, do not block the response, since the // mutation result has already been written to the database. await Promise.allSettled(asyncTasks.map(task => task())) return c.json(result) })",

    "content": "Zero currently supports offline reads, but not writes. When the client is disconnected, error, or closed, mutations are short-circuited and return an error. The lack of offline writes is often surprising to people familiar with sync engines, because offline is usually touted as something that comes for free with these tools. This page explains why Zero doesn't currently support offline writes, how we recommend you handle connectivity loss, and our future plans in this area. Offline Writes are a UX Problem While sync engines can technically queue offline writes and replay them when reconnected, that fact doesn't make supporting offline writes much easier. That's because a really hard part of offline writes is in handling conflicts, and no software tool can make that problem go away. For example, imagine two users are editing an article about cats. One goes offline and does a bunch of work on the article, while the other decides that the article should actually be about dogs and rewrites it. When the offline user reconnects, there is no way that any software algorithm can automatically resolve their conflict. One or the other of them is going to be upset. And while the above example may sound extreme, you can construct similar situations with the majority of common applications. Just take your own application and ask yourself what should really happen if one user takes their device offline for a week and makes arbitrarily complex changes while other users are working online. People who work on sync engines and related tools often say that offline is just extreme lag, but that's only true at a technical level. At a human level, being \"offline\" for a few seconds is very different from being offline for a few hours. The difference is how much knowledge you have about what your collaborators are doing, and how much of your work can be lost. The only way to support offline writes in general is to either: Make the logical datamodel append-only (i.e., users can create and mark tasks done, but cannot edit or delete them). Support custom UX to allow users to fork and merge conflicts when they occur. Only support editing from a single device. None of these is free. Building a good offline UX is a lot of work, and most of that work is borne by application developers. … And a Schema Problem But it's not just users that can diverge from each other. The server software and database schema can also diverge arbitrarily far from the client while the client is disconnected. When the client comes back online, the changes made may no longer be processable by the application, or may have a different effect than the user intended. So to support long offline periods, the server must also maintain backward compatibility with clients indefinitely. Similarly, the server can never reject an offline write (i.e., due to validation) because that could lead to a user losing huge amounts of work. … And a Sync Engine Problem Supporting offline writes also requires work in the sync engine. In Zero, there are a few specific impacts: The Zero client itself can get out of date while offline. On reconnect, the app might reload with a new version of the client. This new version must be able to read and process old data from arbitrarily long ago. An arbitrarily large number of pending mutations can be built up. These mutations must be replayed on reconnect, which can take a long time. When processing mutations on server we must consider what should happen if the database or application server are temporarily unavailable. We need to treat that kind of error differently from a validation error. These problems are surmountable, but significant effort. Their solutions might also be in tension with other goals of the sync engine, like online performance and scalability. These tradeoffs will take time to work through. Zero's Position For all of the above reasons, offline writes are disabled in Zero for beta. If zero-cache cannot reach your API server, the client transitions the connection to needs-auth or error rather than a special offline mode. Mutations are rejected in disconnected, needs-auth, error, and closed. While we recognize that offline writes would be useful for some applications, the reality is that for most of the apps we want to support, the user is online the vast majority of the time and the cost to support offline is extremely high. There is simply more value in making the online experience great first. We would like to revisit this in the future and really think through how to design APIs and patterns that allow developers to make successful offline-enabled apps. But it's not our priority right now.

    "content": "We plan to commercialize Zero in the future by offering a hosted zero-cache service for people who do not want to run it themselves. We expect to charge prices for this roughly comparable to today's database hosting services. We'll also offer white-glove service to help enterprises run zero-cache within their own infrastructure. These plans may change as we develop Zero further. For example, we may also build closed-source companion software – similar to how Docker, Inc. charges for team access to Docker Desktop. But we have no plans to ever change the licensing of the core product: We're building a general-purpose sync engine for the entire web, and we can only do that if the core remains completely open.",

    "content": "Postgres has a massive feature set, and Zero supports a growing subset of it. Object Names Table and column names must begin with a letter or underscore This can be followed by letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens Regex: /^[A-Za-z_]+[A-Za-z0-9_-]*$/ The column name _0_version is reserved for internal use Object Types Tables are synced. Views are not synced. generated as identity columns are synced. In Postgres 18+, generated stored columns are synced. In lower Postgres versions they aren't. Indexes aren't synced per-se, but we do implicitly add indexes to the replica that match the upstream indexes. In the future, this will be customizable. Column Types Postgres Type Type to put in schema.ts Resulting JS/TS Type All numeric types number number char, varchar, text, uuid string string bool boolean boolean date, timestamp, timestampz number number json, jsonb json JSONValue enum enumeration string T[] where T is a supported Postgres type (but please see ⚠️ below) json<U[]> where U is the schema.ts type for T V[] where V is the JS/TS type for T Zero will sync arrays to the client, but there is no support for filtering or joining on array elements yet in ZQL. Other Postgres column types aren’t supported. They will be ignored when replicating (the synced data will be missing that column) and you will get a warning when zero-cache starts up. If your schema has a pg type not listed here, you can support it in Zero by using a trigger to map it to some type that Zero can support. For example if you have a GIS polygon type in the column my_poly polygon, you can use a trigger to map it to a my_poly_json json column. You could either use another trigger to map in the reverse direction to support changes for writes, or you could use a mutator to write to the polygon type directly on the server. Let us know if the lack of a particular column type is hindering your use of Zero. It can likely be added. Column Defaults Default values are allowed in the Postgres schema, but there currently is no way to use them from a Zero app. An insert() mutation requires all columns to be specified, except when columns are nullable (in which case, they default to null). Since there is no way to leave non-nullable columns off the insert on the client, there is no way for PG to apply the default. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the future. IDs It is strongly recommended to use client-generated random strings like uuid, ulid, nanoid, etc for primary keys. This makes optimistic creation and updates much easier. Imagine that the PK of your table is an auto-incrementing integer. If you optimistically create an entity of this type, you will have to give it some ID – the type will require it locally, but also if you want to optimistically create relationships to this row you’ll need an ID. You could sync the highest value seen for that table, but there are race conditions and it is possible for that ID to be taken by the time the creation makes it to the server. Your database can resolve this and assign the next ID, but now the relationships you created optimistically will be against the wrong row. Blech. GUIDs makes a lot more sense in synced applications. If your table has a natural key you can use that and it has less problems. But there is still the chance for a conflict. Imagine you are modeling orgs and you choose domainName as the natural key. It is possible for a race to happen and when the creation gets to the server, somebody has already chosen that domain name. In that case, the best thing to do is reject the write and show the user an error. If you want to have a short auto-incrementing numeric ID for UX reasons (i.e., a bug number), that is possible - see this video. Primary Keys Each table synced with Zero must have either a primary key or at least one unique index. This is needed so that Zero can identify rows during sync, to distinguish between an edit and a remove/add. Multi-column primary and foreign keys are supported. Limiting Replication There are two levels of replication to consider with Zero: replicating from Postgres to zero-cache, and from zero-cache to the Zero browser client. zero-cache replication By default, Zero creates a Postgres publication that publishes all tables in the public schema to zero-cache. To limit which tables or columns are replicated to zero-cache, you can create a Postgres publication with the tables and columns you want: CREATE PUBLICATION zero_data FOR TABLE users (col1, col2, col3, ...), issues, comments; Then, specify this publication in the App Publications zero-cache option. Browser client replication You can use Read Permissions to control which rows are synced from the zero-cache replica to actual clients (e.g., web browsers). Currently, Permissions can limit which tables and rows can be replicated to the client. In the near future, you'll also be able to use Permissions to limit syncing individual columns. Until then, you will need to create a publication to control which columns are synced to zero-cache. Schema changes Most Postgres schema changes are supported as is. Two cases require special handling: Adding columns Adding a column with a non-constant DEFAULT value is not supported. This includes any expression with parentheses, as well as the special functions CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_DATE, and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP (due to a constraint of SQLite). However, the DEFAULT value of an existing column can be changed to any value, including non-constant expressions. To achieve the desired column default: Add the column with no DEFAULT value Backfill the column with desired values Set the column's DEFAULT value BEGIN; ALTER TABLE foo ADD bar ...; -- without a DEFAULT value UPDATE foo SET bar = ...; ALTER TABLE foo ALTER bar SET DEFAULT ...; COMMIT; Changing publications Postgres allows you to change published tables/columns with an ALTER PUBLICATION statement. Zero automatically adjusts the table schemas on the replica, but it does not receive the pre-existing data. To stream the pre-existing data to Zero, make an innocuous UPDATE after adding the tables/columns to the publication: BEGIN; ALTER PUBLICATION zero_data ADD TABLE foo; ALTER TABLE foo REPLICA IDENTITY FULL; UPDATE foo SET id = id; -- For some column \"id\" in \"foo\" ALTER TABLE foo REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT; COMMIT; Self-Referential Relationships See schema",

    "title": "Queries",
    "searchTitle": "Queries",
    "url": "/docs/queries",
    "content": "Queries are how you read and sync data with Zero. Here's a simple example: import {defineQueries, defineQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {z} from 'zod' import {zql} from 'schema.ts' export const queries = defineQueries({ postsByAuthor: defineQuery( z.object({authorID: z.string()}), ({args: {authorID}}) => zql.post.where('authorID', authorID) ) }) Architecture A copy of each query exists on both the client and on your server: Often the implementations will be the same, and you can just share their code. This is easy with full-stack frameworks like TanStack Start or Next.js. But the implementations don't have to be the same, or even compute the same result. For example, the server can add extra filters to enforce permissions that the client query does not. Life of a Query When a query is invoked, it initially runs on the client, against the client-side datastore. Any matching data is returned immediately and the user sees instant results. In the background, the name and arguments for the query are sent to zero-cache. Zero-cache calls the queries endpoint on your server to get the ZQL for the query. Your server looks up its implementation of the query, invokes it, and returns the resulting ZQL expression to zero-cache. Zero-cache then runs this ZQL against the server-side data. The initial server result is sent back to the client and the client query updates in response. zero-cache receives updates from Postgres via logical replication. It updates affected queries and sends row changes back to the client, which updates the client query, and the user sees the changes. Defining Queries Basics Create a query using defineQuery. The only required argument is a QueryFn, which must return a ZQL expression: import {zql} from 'schema.ts' const allPostsQueryDef = defineQuery(() => zql.post) Arguments The QueryFn can take a single args parameter. To enable this, pass a validator to defineQuery: import {zql} from 'schema.ts' const postsByAuthor = defineQuery( z.object({authorID: z.string().optional()}), ({args: {authorID}}) => { let q = zql.post if (authorID !== undefined) { q = q.where('authorID', authorID) } return q } ) We use Zod in these examples, but you can use any validation library that implements Standard Schema. Zero queries run on both the client and on your server. In the server case, the parameters come from the client and are untrusted. The validator ensures the data passed to your query is of the expected type. Query Registries The result of defineQuery is a QueryDefinition. By itself this isn't super useful. You need to register it using defineQueries: export const queries = defineQueries({ posts: { all: allPostsQueryDef } }) Typically these are done together in one step: export const queries = defineQueries({ posts: { all: defineQuery(() => zql.post) } }) The result of defineQueries is called a QueryRegistry. Each field in the registry is a callable Query that you can use to read data: import {zero} from 'zero.ts' import {queries} from 'queries.ts' const allPosts = await zero.run(queries.posts.all()) Query Names Each Query has a queryName which is computed by defineQueries. This name is later sent to your server to identify the query to run: console.log(queries.posts.all.queryName) // \"posts.all\" Context Query parameters are supplied by the client application and passed to the server automatically by Zero. This makes them unsuitable for credentials, since the user could modify them. For this reason, Zero queries also support the concept of a context object. Access your context with the ctx parameter to your query: const myPostsQuery = defineQuery(({ctx: {userID}}) => { // User cannot control context.userID, so this safely // restricts the query to the user's own posts. return zql.post.where('authorID', userID) }) queries.ts By convention, all queries for an application are listed in a central queries.ts file. This allows them to be easily used on both the client and server: import {defineQueries, defineQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {z} from 'zod' import {zql} from './schema.ts' export const queries = defineQueries({ posts: { get: defineQuery(z.string(), id => zql.post.where('id', id) ), byAuthor: defineQuery( z.object({ authorID: z.string(), includeDrafts: z.boolean().optional() }), ({args: {authorID, includeDrafts}}) => { let q = zql.post.where('authorID', authorID) if (!includeDrafts) { q = q.where('isDraft', false) } return q } ) } }) You can use as many levels of nesting as you want to organize your queries. As your application grows, you can move queries to different files to keep them organized: // posts.ts export const postQueries = { get: defineQuery(z.string(), id => zql.post.where('id', id) ) // ... } // users.ts export const userQueries = { byRole: defineQuery(z.string(), role => zql.user.where('role', role) ) // ... } // queries.ts import {postQueries} from './posts.ts' import {userQueries} from './users.ts' export const queries = defineQueries({ posts: postQueries, users: userQueries }) Because defineQueries establishes the full name for each query (i.e., posts.get, users.byRole), it should only be used once at the top level of your queries.ts file. Server Setup In order for queries to sync, you must provide an implementation of the query endpoint on your server. zero-cache calls this endpoint to resolve each query to ZQL that it can run. Registering the Endpoint Use ZERO_QUERY_URL to tell zero-cache where to find your query implementation: export ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"http://localhost:3000/api/zero/query\" # run zero-cache, e.g. `npx zero-cache-dev` Implementing the Endpoint You can use the handleQueryRequest and mustGetQuery functions to implement the endpoint. // src/routes/api/zero/query.ts import {createFileRoute} from '@tanstack/react-router' import {handleQueryRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {queries} from 'queries.ts' import {schema} from 'schema.ts' export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/zero/query')({ server: { handlers: { POST: async ({request}) => { const result = await handleQueryRequest( (name, args) => { const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) return query.fn({args, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }, schema, request ) return Response.json(result) } } } })// app/api/zero/query/route.ts import {handleQueryRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {queries} from 'queries.ts' import {schema} from 'schema.ts' export async function POST(req: Request) { const result = await handleQueryRequest( (name, args) => { const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) return query.fn({args, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }, schema, req ) return Response.json(result) }// src/routes/api/zero/query.ts import type {APIEvent} from '@solidjs/start/server' import {handleQueryRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {queries} from 'queries.ts' import {schema} from 'schema.ts' export async function POST(event: APIEvent) { const result = await handleQueryRequest( (name, args) => { const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) return query.fn({args, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }, schema, event.request ) return new Response.json(result) }// api/app.ts import {handleQueryRequest} from '@rocicorp/zero/server' import {mustGetQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero' import {queries} from 'queries.ts' import {schema} from 'schema.ts' app.post('/api/zero/query', async c => { const result = await handleQueryRequest( (name, args) => { const query = mustGetQuery(queries, name) return query.fn({args, ctx: {userId: 'anon'}}) }, schema, c.req.raw ) return c.json(result) }) handleQueryRequest accepts a standard Request and returns a JSON object which can be serialized and returned by your server framework of choice. mustGetQuery looks up the query in the registry and throws an error if not found. The query.fn function is your query implementation wrapped in the validator you provided. Custom Query URL By default, Zero sends queries to the URL specified in the ZERO_QUERY_URL parameter in the zero-cache config. However you can customize this on a per-client basis. To do so, list multiple comma-separated URLs in ZERO_QUERY_URL: ZERO_QUERY_URL='https://api.example.com/query,https://api.staging.example.com/query' Then choose one of those URLs by passing it to queryURL on the Zero constructor: const zero = new Zero({ schema, queries, queryURL: 'https://api.staging.example.com/query' }) URL Patterns The strings listed in ZERO_QUERY_URL can also be URLPatterns: ZERO_QUERY_URL=\"https://mybranch-*.preview.myapp.com/query\" This queries URL will allow clients to choose URLs like: https://mybranch-aaa.preview.myapp.com/query ✅ https://mybranch-bbb.preview.myapp.com/query ✅ But rejects URLs like: https://preview.myapp.com/query ❌ (missing subdomain) https://malicious.com/query ❌ (different domain) https://mybranch-123.preview.myapp.com/query/extra ❌ (extra path) https://mybranch-123.preview.myapp.com/other ❌ (different path) Because URLPattern is a web standard, you can test them right in your browser: For more information, see the URLPattern docs. Running Queries Reactively The most common way to use queries is with the useQuery reactive hooks from the React or SolidJS bindings (or the equivalent low-level API): import {useQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' import {queries} from 'zero/queries.ts' function App() { const [posts] = useQuery(queries.posts.get('user123')) return posts.map(post => ( <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div> )) }import {useQuery} from '@rocicorp/zero/solid' import {queries} from 'zero/queries.ts' function App() { const [posts] = useQuery(() => queries.posts.get('user123') ) return ( <For each={posts()}> {post => <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>} </For> ) }import {queries} from 'zero/queries.ts' import {zero} from 'zero.ts' const postsView = zero.materialize( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123') ) for (let post of postsView.data) { console.log(post.title) } // updates as the underlying data changes postsView.addListener(posts => { console.log('posts', posts) }) These functions allow you to automatically re-render UI when a query changes. Once You usually want to subscribe to a query in a reactive UI, but every so often you'll need to run a query just once. To do this, use zero.run(): const results = await zero.run( queries.issues.byPriority('high') ) By default, run() only returns results that are currently available on the client. That is, it returns the data that would be given for result.type === 'unknown'. If you want to wait for the server to return results, pass {type: 'complete'} to run: const results = await zero.run( queries.issues.byPriority('high'), {type: 'complete'} ) For Preloading Almost all Zero apps will want to preload some data in order to maximize the feel of instantaneous UI transitions. Because preload queries are often much larger than a screenful of UI, Zero provides a special zero.preload() method to avoid the overhead of materializing the result into JS objects: // Preload a large number of the inbox query results. zero.preload( queries.issues.inbox({ sort: 'created', sortDirection: 'desc', limit: 1000 }) ) Missing Data Because Zero returns local results immediately and server results asynchronously, displaying \"not found\" / 404 UI can be slightly tricky. If you just use a simple existence check, you will often see the 404 UI flicker while the server result loads: const [issue] = useQuery(queries.issues.get('some-id')) // ❌ This causes flickering of the UI if (!issue) { return <div>404 Not Found</div> } else { return <div>{issue.title}</div> }const [issue] = useQuery(() => queries.issues.get('some-id') ) return ( <Show when={issue()}> {resolved => ( <Show when={resolved} fallback={<div>404 Not Found</div>} > <div>{resolved.title}</div> </Show> )} </Show> )const postsView = zero.materialize( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123') ) postsView.addListener(posts => { // ❌ This is updated as data comes in console.log('posts', posts) }) To do this correctly, only display the \"not found\" UI when the result type is complete. This way the 404 page is slow but pages with data are still just as fast: const [issue, issueResult] = useQuery( queries.issues.get('some-id') ) if (!issue && issueResult.type === 'complete') { return <div>404 Not Found</div> } if (!issue) { return null } return <div>{issue.title}</div>const [issue, issueResult] = useQuery(() => queries.issues.get('some-id') ) return ( <Switch fallback={null}> <Match when={issue()}> {resolved => <div>{resolved.title}</div>} </Match> <Match when={issueResult().type === 'complete'}> <div>404 Not Found</div> </Match> </Switch> )const postsView = zero.materialize( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123') ) postsView.addListener((posts, resultType) => { if (resultType === 'complete') { console.log('posts', posts) } }) Partial Data Zero immediately returns the data for a query it has on the client, then falls back to the server for any missing data. Sometimes it's useful to know the difference between these two types of results. To do so, use the result from useQuery: const [issues, issuesResult] = useQuery( queries.issues.inbox() ) if (issuesResult.type === 'complete') { console.log('All data is present') } else { console.log('Some data is missing') }const [issues, issuesResult] = useQuery(() => queries.issues.inbox() ) if (issuesResult().type === 'complete') { console.log('All data is present') } else { console.log('Some data is missing') }const view = zero.materialize(queries.issues.inbox()) view.addListener((issues, resultType) => { if (resultType === 'complete') { console.log('All data is present') } else { console.log('Some data is missing') } }) The possible values of result.type are currently complete and unknown. The complete value is currently only returned when Zero has received the server result. In the future, Zero will be able to return this result type when it knows that all possible data for this query is already available locally. Additionally, we plan to add a prefix result for when the data is known to be a prefix of the complete result. See Consistency for more information. Handling Errors If the queries endpoint throws an application or parse error, zero-cache will report it to the client using the type and error fields on the query details object: const [posts, postsResult] = useQuery( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123') ) if (postsResult.type === 'error') { return ( <div> Error loading posts: {postsResult.error.message} </div> ) }const [posts, postsResult] = useQuery(() => queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123') ) return ( <Switch> <Match when={postsResult().type === 'error'}> <div> Error loading posts: {postsResult().error.message} </div> </Match> </Switch> )// Materialize a view of a query const postsView = queries.posts .byAuthorID('user123') .materialize() postsView.addListener((posts, resultType, error) => { if (resultType === 'error') { console.error('Error loading posts', error) } }) See Connection Status for how HTTP or network errors from the queries endpoint are handled. Granular Updates You can use the materialize() method to create a view that you can listen to for changes. However, this will only tell you when the view has changed and give you the complete new result. It won't tell you what changed. To know what changed, you can create your own custom View implementation: // Inside the View class // Instead of storing the change, we invoke some callback push(change: Change): void { switch (change.type) { case 'add': this.#onAdd?.(change) break case 'remove': this.#onRemove?.(change) break case 'edit': this.#onEdit?.(change) break case 'child': this.#onChild?.(change) break default: throw new Error(`Unknown change type: ${change['type']}`) } } For examples, see the View implementations in zero-vue or zero-solid. Query Caching Queries can be either active or cached. An active query is one that is currently being used by the application. Cached queries are not currently in use, but continue syncing in case they are needed again soon. Queries are deactivated according to how they were created: For useQuery(), the UI unmounts the component (which calls destroy() under the covers). For preload(), the UI calls cleanup() on the return value of preload(). For run(), queries are automatically deactivated immediately after the result is returned. For materialize() queries, the UI calls destroy() on the view. Additionally when a Zero instance closes, all active queries are automatically deactivated. This also happens when the containing page or script is unloaded. TTLs Each query has a ttl that controls how long it stays cached. If the user closes all tabs for your app, Zero stops running and the time that elapses doesn't count toward any TTLs. You do not need to account for such time when choosing a TTL – you only need to account for time your app is running without a query. TTL Defaults In most cases, the default TTL should work well: preload() queries default to ttl:'none', meaning they are not cached at all, and will stop syncing immediately when deactivated. But because preload() queries are typically registered at app startup and never shutdown, and because the ttl clock only ticks while Zero is running, this means that preload queries never get unregistered. Other queries have a default ttl of 5m (five minutes). Setting Different TTLs You can override the default TTL with the ttl parameter: const [user] = useQuery( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), {ttl: '5m'} ) // preload() zero.preload(queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), { ttl: '5m' })const [user] = useQuery( () => queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), {ttl: '5m'} ) // preload() zero().preload(queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), { ttl: '5m' })// run() const user = await zero.run( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), {ttl: '5m'} ) // materialize() const view = zero.materialize( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), {ttl: '5m'} ) // preload() zero.preload(queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), { ttl: '5m' }) TTLs up to 10m (ten minutes) are currently supported. The following formats are allowed: Why Zero TTLs are Short Zero queries are not free. Just as in any database, queries consume resources on both the client and server. Memory is used to keep metadata about the query, and disk storage is used to keep the query's current state. We do drop this state after we haven't heard from a client for awhile, but this is only a partial improvement. If the client returns, we have to re-run the query to get the latest data. This means that we do not actually want to keep queries active unless there is a good chance they will be needed again soon. The default Zero TTL values might initially seem too short, but they are designed to work well with the way Zero's TTL clock works and strike a good balance between keeping queries alive long enough to be useful, while not keeping them alive so long that they consume resources unnecessarily. Local-Only Queries It can sometimes be useful to run queries only on the client. For example, to implement typeahead search, it really doesn't make sense to register a query with the server for every single keystroke. Zero doesn't yet have a way to run named queries local-only, but you can run ZQL expressions locally by passing them anywhere a query is supported. For example, to subscribe to a local-only query: // Queries the already synced data for issues, // without syncing more data. const [issues] = useQuery( zql.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(10) )// Queries the already synced data for issues, // without syncing more data. const [issues] = useQuery(() => zql.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(10) )// Queries the already synced data for issues, // without syncing more data. const view = z.materialize( zql.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(10) ) view.addListener(issues => { console.log('issues', issues) }) Custom Server Implementation It is possible to implement the ZERO_QUERY_URL endpoint without using Zero's TypeScript libraries, or even in a different language entirely. The endpoint receives a POST request with a JSON body of the form: type QueriesRequestBody = { id: string name: string args: readonly ReadonlyJSONValue[] }[] And responds with: type QueriesResponseBody = ( | { id: string name: string // See https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/zero-protocol/src/ast.ts ast: AST } | { error: 'app' id: string name: string details: ReadonlyJSONValue } | { error: 'zero' id: string name: string details: ReadonlyJSONValue } | { error: 'http' id: string name: string status: number details: ReadonlyJSONValue } )[] Consistency Zero always syncs a consistent partial replica of the backend database to the client. This avoids many common consistency issues that come up in classic web applications. But there are still some consistency issues to be aware of when using Zero. For example, imagine that you have a bug database w/ 10k issues. You preload the first 1k issues sorted by created. The user then does a query of issues assigned to themselves, sorted by created. Among the 1k issues that were preloaded imagine 100 are found that match the query. Since the data we preloaded is in the same order as this query, we are guaranteed that any local results found will be a prefix of the server results. The UX that result is nice: the user will see initial results to the query instantly. If more results are found server-side, those results are guaranteed to sort below the local results. There's no shuffling of results when the server response comes in. Now imagine that the user switches the sort to ‘sort by modified’. This new query will run locally, and will again find some local matches. But it is now unlikely that the local results found are a prefix of the server results. When the server result comes in, the user will probably see the results shuffle around. To avoid this annoying effect, what you should do in this example is also preload the first 1k issues sorted by modified desc. In general for any query shape you intend to do, you should preload the first n results for that query shape with no filters, in each sort you intend to use. Zero syncs the union of all active queries' results. You don't have to worry about syncing many sorts of the same query when it's likely the results will overlap heavily. In the future, we will be implementing a consistency model that fixes these issues automatically. We will prevent Zero from returning local data when that data is not known to be a prefix of the server result. Once the consistency model is implemented, preloading can be thought of as purely a performance thing, and not required to avoid unsightly flickering.",

    "content": "Queries can be either active or cached. An active query is one that is currently being used by the application. Cached queries are not currently in use, but continue syncing in case they are needed again soon. Queries are deactivated according to how they were created: For useQuery(), the UI unmounts the component (which calls destroy() under the covers). For preload(), the UI calls cleanup() on the return value of preload(). For run(), queries are automatically deactivated immediately after the result is returned. For materialize() queries, the UI calls destroy() on the view. Additionally when a Zero instance closes, all active queries are automatically deactivated. This also happens when the containing page or script is unloaded. TTLs Each query has a ttl that controls how long it stays cached. If the user closes all tabs for your app, Zero stops running and the time that elapses doesn't count toward any TTLs. You do not need to account for such time when choosing a TTL – you only need to account for time your app is running without a query. TTL Defaults In most cases, the default TTL should work well: preload() queries default to ttl:'none', meaning they are not cached at all, and will stop syncing immediately when deactivated. But because preload() queries are typically registered at app startup and never shutdown, and because the ttl clock only ticks while Zero is running, this means that preload queries never get unregistered. Other queries have a default ttl of 5m (five minutes). Setting Different TTLs You can override the default TTL with the ttl parameter: const [user] = useQuery( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), {ttl: '5m'} ) // preload() zero.preload(queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), { ttl: '5m' })const [user] = useQuery( () => queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), {ttl: '5m'} ) // preload() zero().preload(queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), { ttl: '5m' })// run() const user = await zero.run( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), {ttl: '5m'} ) // materialize() const view = zero.materialize( queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), {ttl: '5m'} ) // preload() zero.preload(queries.posts.byAuthorID('user123'), { ttl: '5m' }) TTLs up to 10m (ten minutes) are currently supported. The following formats are allowed: Why Zero TTLs are Short Zero queries are not free. Just as in any database, queries consume resources on both the client and server. Memory is used to keep metadata about the query, and disk storage is used to keep the query's current state. We do drop this state after we haven't heard from a client for awhile, but this is only a partial improvement. If the client returns, we have to re-run the query to get the latest data. This means that we do not actually want to keep queries active unless there is a good chance they will be needed again soon. The default Zero TTL values might initially seem too short, but they are designed to work well with the way Zero's TTL clock works and strike a good balance between keeping queries alive long enough to be useful, while not keeping them alive so long that they consume resources unnecessarily.",

For example, to implement typeahead search, it really doesn't make sense to register a query with the server for every single keystroke. Zero doesn't yet have a way to run named queries local-only, but you can run ZQL expressions locally by passing them anywhere a query is supported. For example, to subscribe to a local-only query: // Queries the already synced data for issues, // without syncing more data. const [issues] = useQuery( zql.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(10) )// Queries the already synced data for issues, // without syncing more data. const [issues] = useQuery(() => zql.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(10) )// Queries the already synced data for issues, // without syncing more data. const view = z.materialize( zql.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(10) ) view.addListener(issues => { console.log('issues', issues) })",

    "content": "Zero always syncs a consistent partial replica of the backend database to the client. This avoids many common consistency issues that come up in classic web applications. But there are still some consistency issues to be aware of when using Zero. For example, imagine that you have a bug database w/ 10k issues. You preload the first 1k issues sorted by created. The user then does a query of issues assigned to themselves, sorted by created. Among the 1k issues that were preloaded imagine 100 are found that match the query. Since the data we preloaded is in the same order as this query, we are guaranteed that any local results found will be a prefix of the server results. The UX that result is nice: the user will see initial results to the query instantly. If more results are found server-side, those results are guaranteed to sort below the local results. There's no shuffling of results when the server response comes in. Now imagine that the user switches the sort to ‘sort by modified’. This new query will run locally, and will again find some local matches. But it is now unlikely that the local results found are a prefix of the server results. When the server result comes in, the user will probably see the results shuffle around. To avoid this annoying effect, what you should do in this example is also preload the first 1k issues sorted by modified desc. In general for any query shape you intend to do, you should preload the first n results for that query shape with no filters, in each sort you intend to use. Zero syncs the union of all active queries' results. You don't have to worry about syncing many sorts of the same query when it's likely the results will overlap heavily. In the future, we will be implementing a consistency model that fixes these issues automatically. We will prevent Zero from returning local data when that data is not known to be a prefix of the server result. Once the consistency model is implemented, preloading can be thought of as purely a performance thing, and not required to avoid unsightly flickering.",

These infinite TTLs would remain registered even after the app's code changed such that it no longer wanted them, slowing connections and incremental updates to process queries that the app was not even using. Worse, the prevalence of infinite TTLs in turns meant we needed some way to limit the size of the client cache. We introduced the \"client row limit\" for this. But developers would frequently accidentally blow through this limit, causing cache thrash. How TTLs Work Now Now, query TTLs measure \"TTL time\" which only elapses while Zero is running.

    "content": "Installation npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.24 Features Join Flipping: Dramatically improves the performance of whereExists() in many common cases. Join flipping is a form of manual query planning that tells Zero the order to evaluate joins. An automatic planner will follow in a future release. Simplified Auth: If you are using custom mutators and synced queries, you no longer need to use JWT auth. You can use opaque tokens or even better, plain old cookies. This even means you can use HTTP-only cookies. In our demo apps this eliminated hundreds of lines of code. It's a big improvement. Full Preview Support: We tried to get this out in 0.23 but it didn't quite make it. You can now dynamically configure Zero with the location of your mutator and query endpoints. This allows easily using preview URLs on platforms like Vercel. Analyze Query from Inspector: No more npx zero-analyze-query or ssh'ing into production. You can analyze any query right from the dev tools of your browser. On by default in every Zero app. Simplified Metrics Output in Inspector: No more .metrics[\"long-name-i-cant-remember\"].quantile(0.99). The most important metrics – hydration and update time – are right on the query object. Also, you don't have to (await __zero.inspect()).client.queries anymore. It's just __zero.inspector.client.queries(). New Type helpers: QueryResultType and QueryRowType are handy ways to get the type of a query result or one of its rows. Faster storage for React Native via op-sqlite: The op-sqlite bindings are faster than the expo built-in ones. We now provide this built-in to Zero. Brand New Cloudflare Sample: Turned the old hello-zero-do sample into a complete Cloudflare sample using workers for everything. Improved ZQL server-side APIs: More convenient setup, and added node-postgres and Drizzle support. Fixes Expose server errors from get-queries endpoint to client Correctly map primary keys to server names in some edge cases Reduce some OTEL error logging to warn Fix a case of deadlock related to CVR cleanup Fix hang on shutdown under Bun CLI (thanks David!) Fix \"View already exists\" error, Discord Fix rows sometimes missing from startAt queries Improve performance of CVR cleanup Disable statement-level timeouts that were preventing CVR cleanup Fix WAL growth when no connected clients Fix exception with local-only queries and enableLegacyQueries:false Fix inability to use --flags with zero-cache-dev (thanks Alizain!).

    "content": "Join Flipping: Dramatically improves the performance of whereExists() in many common cases. Join flipping is a form of manual query planning that tells Zero the order to evaluate joins. An automatic planner will follow in a future release. Simplified Auth: If you are using custom mutators and synced queries, you no longer need to use JWT auth. You can use opaque tokens or even better, plain old cookies. This even means you can use HTTP-only cookies. In our demo apps this eliminated hundreds of lines of code. It's a big improvement. Full Preview Support: We tried to get this out in 0.23 but it didn't quite make it. You can now dynamically configure Zero with the location of your mutator and query endpoints. This allows easily using preview URLs on platforms like Vercel. Analyze Query from Inspector: No more npx zero-analyze-query or ssh'ing into production. You can analyze any query right from the dev tools of your browser. On by default in every Zero app. Simplified Metrics Output in Inspector: No more .metrics[\"long-name-i-cant-remember\"].quantile(0.99). The most important metrics – hydration and update time – are right on the query object. Also, you don't have to (await __zero.inspect()).client.queries anymore. It's just __zero.inspector.client.queries(). New Type helpers: QueryResultType and QueryRowType are handy ways to get the type of a query result or one of its rows. Faster storage for React Native via op-sqlite: The op-sqlite bindings are faster than the expo built-in ones. We now provide this built-in to Zero. Brand New Cloudflare Sample: Turned the old hello-zero-do sample into a complete Cloudflare sample using workers for everything. Improved ZQL server-side APIs: More convenient setup, and added node-postgres and Drizzle support.",

    "content": "Installation npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.25 Overview This release massively overhauls and simplifies the entire Zero API. Conceptually, Zero is now just schemas, queries, and mutators. There are no longer first-class auth or permission systems. There are no longer \"custom mutators\" and \"crud mutators\", or \"synced queries\" and \"zql queries\". All the old APIs have been deprecated, and the docs have been rewritten and simpilfied. Additionally, this release introduces a raft of big new features. To ease the transition, and allow access to new features without a ton of work, you can still use the old APIs via the enableLegacyQueries and enableLegacyMutators flags. Note that support for these older APIs will be removed for the Zero beta early next year. Upgrading We have implemented both \"minimal\" and \"maximal\" sample upgrades. The minimal upgrades show how to update to 0.25 with very little work, by opting into deprecated APIs: ztunes minimal: Minimal React upgrade. hello-zero-solid minimal: Minimal SolidJS upgrade. The maximal upgrades show how to use all the new features. Refer to the commit log of each PR for step-by-step examples of how to upgrade: ztunes maximal: Maximal React upgrade. hello-zero-solid maximal: Maximal SolidJS upgrade. zslack: Maximal React Native upgrade. hello-zero-cf: Maximal Cloudflare upgrade. Additionally, the old hello-zero sample has been updated from the original CRUD mutators and queries all the way to the latest hotness. So if you were still using those APIs, you can use this as a guide to upgrade. Features Query Planning: Zero now automatically plans joins, similar to other databases. You no longer need to specify flip:true to optimize whereExists() calls. Reworked Query DX: Queries now receive a Context automatically – you don't have to pass it at the call site. Also, any Standard Schema conforming library can be used for validation and the API has been generally simplified and streamlined. Reworked Mutator DX: The mutator API has been overhauled to match queries. Mutators now also support validation. drizzle-zero and prisma-zero are now first-class: They have moved into the rocicorp org and are now officially supported. Default Schema Type: The Schema type can now be registered as a default with Zero. You can just say useZero() – useZero<Schema> is no longer needed. You can also delete your createUseZero() helper if you have one. This registration happens by default if you use the new drizzle-zero or prisma-zero packages. New Connection Status API: Brand new connection status API with overhauled error-handling and reconnection behavior. Mutator promises now return structured errors: The client and server promises now always resolve. In the case of an error, they now return a structured error object. New Install Guide: Rewritten guide to add Zero to an existing project. New zero-out tool: Removes all trace of Zero from Postgres. Support for Generated Columns: In Postgres 18+, generated stored columns are now synced. This is useful for denormalizing data from JSON columns to support filtering in Zero. Performance Queries should be 0.2x to 4x faster, depending on the query. Some highlights: Only cache for duration of fetch in exists: 60% improvement on sparse exists queries. Do not fetch on null constraint: 33% improvement on some queries. Remove join storage: ~25% improvement in queries with related calls. Fixes Cooperative concurrency for queries ZERO_REPLICA_FILE now defaults to zero.db serverURL renamed to cacheURL GET_QUERIES renamed to QUERY throughout Ping timeouts now configurable in constructor and at runtime Add configurable WebSocket compression tx.upsert should not overwrite w/ null on missing value sourceField in schema wasn't strongly typed Avoid unique violations during push caused by history compression Invalid SQL was being generated for arrays Handle connections to a view-syncer that has shut down properly Process pending messages on closed websocket Do not hydrate queries if no clients initialized Inspector.analyzeQuery() wasn't mapping names Add flow control to subscriber catchup Migrate TTL/inactivatedAt to DOUBLE PRECISION with clamping Continuous change-log cleanup for single-node Count SQLite row scans, not what is returned to us Make schema path optional for zero-cache-dev (thanks @mattkinnersley!)

Breaking Changes Despite the large DX update, we tried to make the upgrade as smooth as possible. However, there are a few breaking changes we could not easily avoid. If you do not want to immediately opt-in to the new query and mutator APIs, set enableLegacyQueries and enableLegacyMutators to true in your schema.ts. If you are using the .client or .server promises with custom mutators, these no longer ever reject. They now always resolve with a result type that has success/error cases Mutators now reject while Zero is offline. You may want to use the new Connection Status API to detect this and display custom UI to users. The pattern for reauthentication has changed. The auth parameter is now always a string – the function form is no longer supported. Instead, call zero.connection.connect({auth: token}) to reconnect. This was done to simplify the API and support reauth via cookies consistently. The onError feature of Zero has been removed. It was undocumented and only half-working. Please use the new Connection Status API to detect errors and display custom UI to users.",

    "url": "/docs/schema",
    "content": "Zero applications have both a database schema (the normal backend schema all web apps have) and a Zero schema. The Zero schema is conventionally located in schema.ts in your app's source code. The Zero schema serves two purposes: Provide typesafety for ZQL queries Define first-class relationships between tables The Zero schema is usually generated from your backend schema, but can be defined by hand for more control. Generating from Database If you use Drizzle or Prisma ORM, you can generate schema.ts with drizzle-zero or prisma-zero: npm install -D drizzle-zero npx drizzle-zero generatepnpm add -D drizzle-zero pnpm dlx drizzle-zero generatebun add -D drizzle-zero bunx drizzle-zero generateyarn add -D drizzle-zero yarn dlx drizzle-zero generatenpm install -D prisma-zero # Add this to your prisma schema: # generator zero { # provider = \"prisma-zero\" # } npx prisma generatepnpm add -D prisma-zero # Add this to your prisma schema: # generator zero { # provider = \"prisma-zero\" # } pnpx prisma generatebun add -D prisma-zero # Add this to your prisma schema: # generator zero { # provider = \"prisma-zero\" # } bunx prisma generateyarn add -D prisma-zero # Add this to your prisma schema: # generator zero { # provider = \"prisma-zero\" # } yarn prisma generate We'd love more! See the source for drizzle-zero and prisma-zero as a guide, or reach out on Discord with questions. Writing by Hand You can also write Zero schemas by hand for full control. Table Schemas Use the table function to define each table in your Zero schema: import {table, string, boolean} from '@rocicorp/zero' const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string(), partner: boolean() }) .primaryKey('id') Column types are defined with the boolean(), number(), string(), json(), and enumeration() helpers. See Column Types for how database types are mapped to these types. Name Mapping Use from() to map a TypeScript table or column name to a different database name: const userPref = table('userPref') // Map TS \"userPref\" to DB name \"user_pref\" .from('user_pref') .columns({ id: string(), // Map TS \"orgID\" to DB name \"org_id\" orgID: string().from('org_id') }) Multiple Schemas You can also use from() to access other Postgres schemas: // Sync the \"event\" table from the \"analytics\" schema. const event = table('event').from('analytics.event') Optional Columns Columns can be marked optional. This corresponds to the SQL concept nullable. const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string(), nickName: string().optional() }) .primaryKey('id') An optional column can store a value of the specified type or null to mean no value. Note that null and undefined mean different things when working with Zero rows. When reading, if a column is optional, Zero can return null for that field. undefined is not used at all when Reading from Zero. When writing, you can specify null for an optional field to explicitly write null to the datastore, unsetting any previous value. For create and upsert you can set optional fields to undefined (or leave the field off completely) to take the default value as specified by backend schema for that column. For update you can set any non-PK field to undefined to leave the previous value unmodified. Enumerations Use the enumeration helper to define a column that can only take on a specific set of values. This is most often used alongside an enum Postgres column type. import {table, string, enumeration} from '@rocicorp/zero' const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string(), mood: enumeration<'happy' | 'sad' | 'taco'>() }) .primaryKey('id') Custom JSON Types Use the json helper to define a column that stores a JSON-compatible value: import {table, string, json} from '@rocicorp/zero' const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string(), settings: json<{theme: 'light' | 'dark'}>() }) .primaryKey('id') Compound Primary Keys Pass multiple columns to primaryKey to define a compound primary key: const user = table('user') .columns({ orgID: string(), userID: string(), name: string() }) .primaryKey('orgID', 'userID') Relationships Use the relationships function to define relationships between tables. Use the one and many helpers to define singular and plural relationships, respectively: const messageRelationships = relationships( message, ({one, many}) => ({ sender: one({ sourceField: ['senderID'], destField: ['id'], destSchema: user }), replies: many({ sourceField: ['id'], destSchema: message, destField: ['parentMessageID'] }) }) ) This creates \"sender\" and \"replies\" relationships that can later be queried with the related ZQL clause: const messagesWithSenderAndReplies = z.query.messages .related('sender') .related('replies') This will return an object for each message row. Each message will have a sender field that is a single User object or null, and a replies field that is an array of Message objects. Many-to-Many Relationships You can create many-to-many relationships by chaining the relationship definitions. Assuming issue and label tables, along with an issueLabel junction table, you can define a labels relationship like this: const issueRelationships = relationships( issue, ({many}) => ({ labels: many( { sourceField: ['id'], destSchema: issueLabel, destField: ['issueID'] }, { sourceField: ['labelID'], destSchema: label, destField: ['id'] } ) }) ) See https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3454. Compound Keys Relationships Relationships can traverse compound keys. Imagine a user table with a compound primary key of orgID and userID, and a message table with a related senderOrgID and senderUserID. This can be represented in your schema with: const messageRelationships = relationships( message, ({one}) => ({ sender: one({ sourceField: ['senderOrgID', 'senderUserID'], destSchema: user, destField: ['orgID', 'userID'] }) }) ) Circular Relationships Circular relationships are fully supported: const commentRelationships = relationships( comment, ({one}) => ({ parent: one({ sourceField: ['parentID'], destSchema: comment, destField: ['id'] }) }) ) Database Schemas Use createSchema to define the entire Zero schema: import {createSchema} from '@rocicorp/zero' export const schema = createSchema({ tables: [user, medium, message], relationships: [ userRelationships, mediumRelationships, messageRelationships ] }) Default Type Parameter Use DefaultTypes to register the your Schema type with Zero: declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { schema: Schema } } This prevents having to pass Schema manually to every Zero API. Migrations Zero uses TypeScript-style structural typing to detect schema changes and implement smooth migrations. How it Works When the Zero client connects to zero-cache it sends a copy of the schema it was constructed with. zero-cache compares this schema to the one it has, and rejects the connection with a special error code if the schema is incompatible. By default, the Zero client handles this error code by calling location.reload(). The intent is to request a newer version of the app that has been updated to handle the new server schema. It's important to update the database schema first, then the app. Otherwise a reload loop will occur. If a reload loop does occur, Zero uses exponential backoff to avoid overloading the server. If you want to change or delay this reload, you can do so by providing the onUpdateNeeded constructor parameter: new Zero({ onUpdateNeeded: updateReason => { if (reason.type === 'SchemaVersionNotSupported') { // Do something custom here, like show a banner. // When you're ready, call `location.reload()`. } } }) If the schema changes in a compatible way while a client is running, zero-cache syncs the schema change to the client so that it's ready when the app reloads. If the schema changes in an incompatible way while a client is running, zero-cache will close the client connection with the same error code as above. Schema Change Process Like other database-backed applications, Zero schema migrations generally follow an \"expand/migrate/contract\" pattern: Implement and run an \"expand\" migration on the backend that is backwards compatible with existing schemas. Add new columns or tables, plus any defaults and triggers needed for compatibility with existing clients. Update and deploy the API and client app to use the new schema. After a grace period, implement and run a \"contract\" migration on the backend to drop or rename obsolete columns/tables. Steps 1 and 2 can generally be done as part of a single deploy in your CI pipeline, but step 3 should be weeks later, when most open clients have refreshed the application. See Rolling Updates for more details. Certain schema changes require special handling in Postgres. See Schema Changes for details.",

Table Schemas Use the table function to define each table in your Zero schema: import {table, string, boolean} from '@rocicorp/zero' const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string(), partner: boolean() }) .primaryKey('id') Column types are defined with the boolean(), number(), string(), json(), and enumeration() helpers. See Column Types for how database types are mapped to these types. Name Mapping Use from() to map a TypeScript table or column name to a different database name: const userPref = table('userPref') // Map TS \"userPref\" to DB name \"user_pref\" .from('user_pref') .columns({ id: string(), // Map TS \"orgID\" to DB name \"org_id\" orgID: string().from('org_id') }) Multiple Schemas You can also use from() to access other Postgres schemas: // Sync the \"event\" table from the \"analytics\" schema. const event = table('event').from('analytics.event') Optional Columns Columns can be marked optional. This corresponds to the SQL concept nullable. const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string(), nickName: string().optional() }) .primaryKey('id') An optional column can store a value of the specified type or null to mean no value. Note that null and undefined mean different things when working with Zero rows. When reading, if a column is optional, Zero can return null for that field. undefined is not used at all when Reading from Zero. When writing, you can specify null for an optional field to explicitly write null to the datastore, unsetting any previous value. For create and upsert you can set optional fields to undefined (or leave the field off completely) to take the default value as specified by backend schema for that column. For update you can set any non-PK field to undefined to leave the previous value unmodified. Enumerations Use the enumeration helper to define a column that can only take on a specific set of values. This is most often used alongside an enum Postgres column type. import {table, string, enumeration} from '@rocicorp/zero' const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string(), mood: enumeration<'happy' | 'sad' | 'taco'>() }) .primaryKey('id') Custom JSON Types Use the json helper to define a column that stores a JSON-compatible value: import {table, string, json} from '@rocicorp/zero' const user = table('user') .columns({ id: string(), name: string(), settings: json<{theme: 'light' | 'dark'}>() }) .primaryKey('id') Compound Primary Keys Pass multiple columns to primaryKey to define a compound primary key: const user = table('user') .columns({ orgID: string(), userID: string(), name: string() }) .primaryKey('orgID', 'userID') Relationships Use the relationships function to define relationships between tables. Use the one and many helpers to define singular and plural relationships, respectively: const messageRelationships = relationships( message, ({one, many}) => ({ sender: one({ sourceField: ['senderID'], destField: ['id'], destSchema: user }), replies: many({ sourceField: ['id'], destSchema: message, destField: ['parentMessageID'] }) }) ) This creates \"sender\" and \"replies\" relationships that can later be queried with the related ZQL clause: const messagesWithSenderAndReplies = z.query.messages .related('sender') .related('replies') This will return an object for each message row. Each message will have a sender field that is a single User object or null, and a replies field that is an array of Message objects. Many-to-Many Relationships You can create many-to-many relationships by chaining the relationship definitions. Assuming issue and label tables, along with an issueLabel junction table, you can define a labels relationship like this: const issueRelationships = relationships( issue, ({many}) => ({ labels: many( { sourceField: ['id'], destSchema: issueLabel, destField: ['issueID'] }, { sourceField: ['labelID'], destSchema: label, destField: ['id'] } ) }) ) See https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3454.

Imagine a user table with a compound primary key of orgID and userID, and a message table with a related senderOrgID and senderUserID. This can be represented in your schema with: const messageRelationships = relationships( message, ({one}) => ({ sender: one({ sourceField: ['senderOrgID', 'senderUserID'], destSchema: user, destField: ['orgID', 'userID'] }) }) ) Circular Relationships Circular relationships are fully supported: const commentRelationships = relationships( comment, ({one}) => ({ parent: one({ sourceField: ['parentID'], destSchema: comment, destField: ['id'] }) }) ) Database Schemas Use createSchema to define the entire Zero schema: import {createSchema} from '@rocicorp/zero' export const schema = createSchema({ tables: [user, medium, message], relationships: [ userRelationships, mediumRelationships, messageRelationships ] }) Default Type Parameter Use DefaultTypes to register the your Schema type with Zero: declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { schema: Schema } } This prevents having to pass Schema manually to every Zero API.",

How it Works When the Zero client connects to zero-cache it sends a copy of the schema it was constructed with. zero-cache compares this schema to the one it has, and rejects the connection with a special error code if the schema is incompatible. By default, the Zero client handles this error code by calling location.reload(). The intent is to request a newer version of the app that has been updated to handle the new server schema. It's important to update the database schema first, then the app. Otherwise a reload loop will occur. If a reload loop does occur, Zero uses exponential backoff to avoid overloading the server. If you want to change or delay this reload, you can do so by providing the onUpdateNeeded constructor parameter: new Zero({ onUpdateNeeded: updateReason => { if (reason.type === 'SchemaVersionNotSupported') { // Do something custom here, like show a banner. // When you're ready, call `location.reload()`. } } }) If the schema changes in a compatible way while a client is running, zero-cache syncs the schema change to the client so that it's ready when the app reloads. If the schema changes in an incompatible way while a client is running, zero-cache will close the client connection with the same error code as above. Schema Change Process Like other database-backed applications, Zero schema migrations generally follow an \"expand/migrate/contract\" pattern: Implement and run an \"expand\" migration on the backend that is backwards compatible with existing schemas. Add new columns or tables, plus any defaults and triggers needed for compatibility with existing clients. Update and deploy the API and client app to use the new schema. After a grace period, implement and run a \"contract\" migration on the backend to drop or rename obsolete columns/tables. Steps 1 and 2 can generally be done as part of a single deploy in your CI pipeline, but step 3 should be weeks later, when most open clients have refreshed the application.

    "content": "The Zero package includes utilities to run ZQL on the server directly against your upstream Postgres database. This is useful for many reasons: It allows mutators to read data using ZQL to check permissions or invariants. You can use ZQL to implement standard REST endpoints, allowing you to share code with mutators. In the future (but not yet implemented), this can support server-side rendering. ZQLDatabase currently does a read of your postgres schema before every transaction. This is fine for most usages, but for high scale it may become a problem. Let us know if you need a fix for this. Creating a Database To run ZQL on the database, you will create a ZQLDatabase instance. Zero ships with several built-in factories for popular Postgres bindings libraries. // app/api/mutate/db-provider.ts import {zeroDrizzle} from '@rocicorp/zero/server/adapters/drizzle' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' import * as drizzleSchema from '../../drizzle/schema.ts' // pass a drizzle client instance. for example: export const drizzleClient = drizzle(pool, { schema: drizzleSchema }) export const dbProvider = zeroDrizzle(schema, drizzleClient) // Register the database provider for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { dbProvider: typeof dbProvider } }// app/api/mutate/db-provider.ts import {PrismaPg} from '@prisma/adapter-pg' import {PrismaClient} from '@prisma/client' import {zeroPrisma} from '@rocicorp/zero/server/adapters/prisma' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter: new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB! }) }) export const dbProvider = zeroPrisma(schema, prisma) // Register the database provider for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { dbProvider: typeof dbProvider } }// app/api/mutate/db-provider.ts import {zeroNodePg} from '@rocicorp/zero/server/adapters/pg' import {Pool} from 'pg' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB! }) export const dbProvider = zeroNodePg(schema, pool) // You can also pass a client instead of a pool: // // const client = new Client({ // connectionString: process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB! // }) // await client.connect() // export const dbProvider = zeroNodePg(schema, client) // Register the database provider for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { dbProvider: typeof dbProvider } }// app/api/mutate/db-provider.ts import {zeroPostgresJS} from '@rocicorp/zero/server/adapters/postgresjs' import postgres from 'postgres' import {schema} from '../../zero/schema.ts' const sql = postgres(process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB!) export const dbProvider = zeroPostgresJS(schema, sql) // Register the database provider for type safety declare module '@rocicorp/zero' { interface DefaultTypes { dbProvider: typeof dbProvider } } Within your mutators, you can access the underlying transaction via tx.dbTransaction.wrappedTransaction: // mutators.ts export const mutators = defineMutators({ createUser: defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), name: z.string()}), async ({tx, args: {id, name}}) => { if (tx.location === 'server') { await tx.dbTransaction.wrappedTransaction .insert(drizzleSchema.user) .values({id, name}) } } ) })// mutators.ts export const mutators = defineMutators({ createUser: defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), name: z.string()}), async ({tx, args: {id, name}}) => { if (tx.location === 'server') { await tx.dbTransaction.wrappedTransaction.user.create( { data: { id, name, status: 'active' } } ) } } ) })// mutators.ts export const mutators = defineMutators({ createUser: defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), name: z.string()}), async ({tx, args: {id, name}}) => { if (tx.location === 'server') { await tx.dbTransaction.wrappedTransaction.query( 'insert into \"user\" (id, name) values ($1, $2) returning *', [id, name] ) } } ) })// mutators.ts export const mutators = defineMutators({ createUser: defineMutator( z.object({id: z.string(), name: z.string()}), async ({tx, args: {id, name}}) => { if (tx.location === 'server') { await tx.dbTransaction.wrappedTransaction< {id: string; name: string}[] >`insert into \"user\" (id, name) values (${id}, ${name}) returning *` } } ) }) Custom Database To implement support for some other Postgres bindings library, you will implement the DBConnection interface. See the implementations for the existing adapters for examples. Running ZQL Once you have an instance of ZQLDatabase, use the transaction() method to run ZQL: await dbProvider.transaction(async tx => { // await tx.mutate... // await tx.query... // await myMutator.fn({tx, ctx, args}) }) SSR Zero doesn't yet have the wiring setup in its bindings layers to really nicely support server-side rendering (patches welcome though!). For now, we don't recommend using Zero with SSR. Use your framework's recommended pattern to prevent SSR execution: import {lazy} from 'react' // Use React lazy to defer loading the ZeroProvider const ZeroProvider = lazy(() => import('@rocicorp/zero/react').then(mod => ({ default: mod.ZeroProvider })) ) function Root() { return ( <ZeroProvider> <App /> </ZeroProvider> ) }// Mark client-only components 'use client' import {ZeroProvider} from '@rocicorp/zero/react' export default function Root() { return ( <ZeroProvider> <App /> </ZeroProvider> ) }import {clientOnly} from '@solidjs/start' const ZeroProvider = clientOnly(async () => { // Optionally dynamic import to code-split return import('@rocicorp/zero/solid').then(mod => ({ default: mod.ZeroProvider })) }) export default function Root() { return ( <ZeroProvider> <App /> </ZeroProvider> ) }",

You may encounter pathologically slow queries. You are likely to encounter situations where ZQL is not powerful enough to express the query you want. That said, we are building Zero live. It has been running our own bug tracker for months, and is used in production by a small set of customer applications that are an extremely good fit. This page describes the current state of Zero at a high level. To understand whether Zero makes sense for you, please also see When to Use Zero. Platforms and Frameworks React, React Native, and SolidJS are fully supported. Svelte and Vue have community support. We have strong support for TanStack. Databases Most Postgres providers are supported. Drizzle and Prisma are fully supported. API The new APIs are still being refined and have some rough edges. Query Language Filters, sorts, limits, relationships, and exists are supported. Queries can have ttl to keep data synced across sessions. Aggregates (count, min, max, group-by) are not yet supported. Full-text search is not yet supported (you can sometimes simulate with ILIKE, though it scales linearly). Infinite/virtual scroll is possible, but we do not yet have a library/API for it. See zbugs source for how to do this. Performance Zero plans single-table and multi-table queries. You can also manually plan queries using the flip parameter. Zero has a basic console-based inspector that can help to understand query and sync performance. It does not yet have a GUI inspector. We share queries within a \"client group\" (e.g. all tabs in a browser), but not across groups. This means that if you have many users doing the same query, they will duplicate all that work server-side. Miscellaneous Running Zero requires deploying it yourself to AWS or similar. Running in a multinode, zero-downtime way is possible (we do it for zbugs), but significant effort.

    "content": "We say that Zero is a sync engine. But what even is that? And why does it matter? A sync engine is a type of software that keeps multiple copies of changing data consistent across devices and users. When the data changes, the sync engine ensures that all copies reflect those changes. Problem Let's say you have some data that you want to read and write from multiple devices. The most common way to do this today is to put that data into a central database and expose access to it via APIs. This works, but has downsides: Slow access. Every read and write has to go to the server, adding hundreds of milliseconds to each interaction. Stale data. API responses are immediately stale. The client has no way to know when to refresh them. Users may make decisions based on old information, and the views on different devices diverge over time. Online-only. If the server or the user's network connection is down, the app stops working completely. Solution Sync engines can solve these problems by keeping a local copy of the data on each device. The app reads and writes only to the local copy, not to the network. The sync engine pushes changes back and forth between the local copy and the server in the background, when connectivity allows. If the sync engine allows writes from multiple devices, conflicts can occur. This is a central part of sync engine design, and different sync engines handle conflicts differently. Zero uses server reconciliation – an elegant and flexible technique pioneered by the video game industry. This architecture can enable: Instant UI. Reads and writes are to local storage, effectively instant. Realtime updates. By running the sync engine continuously, users can see updates from other devices and users in realtime. The data is always fresh. Offline support. Because data is stored locally, it is possible to support at least limited offline access. For example, Zero supports read-only access while offline, and other sync engines support some limited offline writes. Sync engines also simplify the development of complex apps. Big parts of modern app development are just data plumbing: fetching data, updating data, caching data, invalidating caches, keeping different copies of data consistent, and so-on. A sync engine abstracts all this away and lets you focus on what your app actually does. History of Sync Sync Engines have been around a long time. The first mass-market sync engine was probably Lotus Notes, released way back in 1989! Since then, there has been a steady trickle of important software built on sync engines: Microsoft Exchange (1996) Google Docs (2006) Dropbox (2007) Figma (2016) Superhuman (2017) Linear (2019) But sync engines are very hard to build. Typically, a new custom sync engine is built for each application at great expense. Knowledge about the specific application and its data model must be built into each sync engine to correctly handle conflicts and partial sync. There have also been some attempts at general-purpose sync engines: Firebase Realtime Database (2012) - a cloud-hosted database and that syncs. PouchDB (2013) - a sync engine attachment for CouchDB. Realm (2016) - a mobile database with sync capabilities. Replicache (2020) - The predecessor to Zero, a JavaScript library for building collaborative applications with real-time sync. But all have suffered from one or more significant problems that have prevented widespread adoption: No support for fine-grained authorization Limited support for partial sync – users have to sync all data, even if they only need a small subset Required adoption of non-standard backend databases or data models Limited ability to put custom business logic on read or write paths We are building Zero to address these limitations, and bring the benefits of sync to many more applications.",

    "content": "We are trying to make Zero a great choice for a wide variety of applications. But every tool has tradeoffs, and Zero especially so while in alpha. This page will help you understand if Zero is a good fit for you today. Zero Might be a Good Fit You want to sync only a small subset of data to client Zero's query-driven sync is a powerful solution for partial sync. You can define the data you want to sync with a set of Zero queries. By using partial sync, Zero apps can commonly load in < 1s, yet still maintain the interaction perf of sync. You need fine-grained read or write permissions Zero's mutators allow you to run arbitrary authorization, validation, or business logic on the write path. You can enforce that a write depends on what group a user is in, what has been shared with them, their role, etc. Read permissions are very expressive, allowing similar control over what data is synced to the client. You are building a traditional client-server web app Zero was designed from the ground up to be as close to a classic web app as a sync engine can be. If you have a traditional web app, you can try Zero side-by-side with your existing REST or GraphQL API, and incrementally migrate over time. You use PostgreSQL Some tools in our space require you to use a non-standard backend database or data model. Zero works with PostgreSQL, and uses your existing schema. Your app is broadly \"like Linear\" Zero is currently best suited for productivity apps with lots of interactivity. Interaction performance is very important to you Zero was built by people obsessed with interaction performance. If you share this goal you'll be going with the grain of Zero's design choices. Zero Might Not be a Good Fit You need the privacy or data ownership benefits of local-first Zero is not local-first. It's a client-server system with an authoritative server. You need to support offline writes or long periods offline Zero doesn't support offline writes yet. You are building a native mobile app Zero is written in TypeScript and only supports TypeScript clients. The total backend dataset is > ~100GB Zero stores a replica of your database (at least the subset you want to be syncable to clients) in a SQLite database owned by zero-cache. Zero's query engine is built assuming very fast local access to this replica (i.e., attached NVMe). But other setups are technically supported and work for smaller data. The ultimate size limit on the database that Zero can work with is the size limit of this SQLite database. So up to 45TB on EC2 at time of writing. However, most of our experience with Zero so far is with much smaller workloads. We currently recommend Zero for use with datasets smaller than 100GB, but are working to improve this in the beta timeframe. Zero Might Not be a Good Fit Yet While Zero is in alpha, there are additional reasons not to choose it: You don't want to run server-side infra Zero is a Docker container that you currently have to self-host. We're working on a SaaS solution but it's not ready yet. You can't tolerate occasional downtime The easiest way to run Zero today is single-node, which requires downtime for updates. Also there are occasional regressions. You need support for SSR Zero doesn't support SSR yet, but it is planned. Alternatives If Zero isn't right for you, here are some good alternatives to consider: Automerge: Local-first, CRDT-based solution. Pioneering branch-based offline support. Convex: Not a sync engine (reads and writes are server-first), but a very nice reactive database that is in GA. Ditto: CRDT-based, with high quality offline support. Electric: Postgres-based sync engine with a SaaS cloud. LiveStore: Interesting event sourced design from one of the founders of Prisma. Jazz: Batteries-included local-first.

    "content": "zero-cache is configured either via CLI flag or environment variable. There is no separate zero.config file. You can also see all available flags by running zero-cache --help. Required Flags Upstream DB The \"upstream\" authoritative postgres database. In the future we will support other types of upstream besides PG. flag: --upstream-db env: ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB required: true Admin Password A password used to administer zero-cache server, for example to access the /statz endpoint and the inspector. This is required in production (when NODE_ENV=production) because we want all Zero servers to be debuggable using admin tools by default, without needing a restart. But we also don't want to expose sensitive data using them. flag: --admin-password env: ZERO_ADMIN_PASSWORD required: in production (when NODE_ENV=production) Optional Flags App ID Unique identifier for the app. Multiple zero-cache apps can run on a single upstream database, each of which is isolated from the others, with its own permissions, sharding (future feature), and change/cvr databases. The metadata of an app is stored in an upstream schema with the same name, e.g. zero, and the metadata for each app shard, e.g. client and mutation ids, is stored in the {app-id}_{#} schema. (Currently there is only a single \"0\" shard, but this will change with sharding). The CVR and Change data are managed in schemas named {app-id}_{shard-num}/cvr and {app-id}_{shard-num}/cdc, respectively, allowing multiple apps and shards to share the same database instance (e.g. a Postgres \"cluster\") for CVR and Change management. Due to constraints on replication slot names, an App ID may only consist of lower-case letters, numbers, and the underscore character. Note that this option is used by both zero-cache and zero-deploy-permissions. flag: --app-id env: ZERO_APP_ID default: zero App Publications Postgres PUBLICATIONs that define the tables and columns to replicate. Publication names may not begin with an underscore, as zero reserves that prefix for internal use. If unspecified, zero-cache will create and use an internal publication that publishes all tables in the public schema, i.e.: CREATE PUBLICATION _{app-id}_public_0 FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA public; Note that changing the set of publications will result in resyncing the replica, which may involve downtime (replication lag) while the new replica is initializing. To change the set of publications without disrupting an existing app, a new app should be created. flag: --app-publications env: ZERO_APP_PUBLICATIONS default: [] Auto Reset Automatically wipe and resync the replica when replication is halted. This situation can occur for configurations in which the upstream database provider prohibits event trigger creation, preventing the zero-cache from being able to correctly replicate schema changes. For such configurations, an upstream schema change will instead result in halting replication with an error indicating that the replica needs to be reset. When auto-reset is enabled, zero-cache will respond to such situations by shutting down, and when restarted, resetting the replica and all synced clients. This is a heavy-weight operation and can result in user-visible slowness or downtime if compute resources are scarce. flag: --auto-reset env: ZERO_AUTO_RESET default: true Change DB The Postgres database used to store recent replication log entries, in order to sync multiple view-syncers without requiring multiple replication slots on the upstream database. If unspecified, the upstream-db will be used. flag: --change-db env: ZERO_CHANGE_DB Change Max Connections The maximum number of connections to open to the change database. This is used by the change-streamer for catching up zero-cache replication subscriptions. flag: --change-max-conns env: ZERO_CHANGE_MAX_CONNS default: 5 Change Streamer Mode The mode for running or connecting to the change-streamer: dedicated: runs the change-streamer and shuts down when another change-streamer takes over the replication slot. This is appropriate in a single-node configuration, or for the replication-manager in a multi-node configuration. discover: connects to the change-streamer as internally advertised in the change-db. This is appropriate for the view-syncers in a multi-node setup. This may not work in all networking configurations (e.g., some private networking or port forwarding setups). Using ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI with an explicit routable hostname is recommended instead. This option is ignored if ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI is set. flag: --change-streamer-mode env: ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_MODE default: dedicated Change Streamer Port The port on which the change-streamer runs. This is an internal protocol between the replication-manager and view-syncers, which runs in the same process tree in local development or a single-node configuration. If unspecified, defaults to --port + 1. flag: --change-streamer-port env: ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_PORT default: --port + 1 Change Streamer Startup Delay (ms) The delay to wait before the change-streamer takes over the replication stream (i.e. the handoff during replication-manager updates), to allow load balancers to register the task as healthy based on healthcheck parameters. If a change stream request is received during this interval, the delay will be canceled and the takeover will happen immediately, since the incoming request indicates that the task is registered as a target. flag: --change-streamer-startup-delay-ms env: ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_STARTUP_DELAY_MS default: 15000 Change Streamer URI When set, connects to the change-streamer at the given URI. In a multi-node setup, this should be specified in view-syncer options, pointing to the replication-manager URI, which runs a change-streamer on port 4849. flag: --change-streamer-uri env: ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI CVR DB The Postgres database used to store CVRs. CVRs (client view records) keep track of the data synced to clients in order to determine the diff to send on reconnect. If unspecified, the upstream-db will be used. flag: --cvr-db env: ZERO_CVR_DB CVR Garbage Collection Inactivity Threshold Hours The duration after which an inactive CVR is eligible for garbage collection. Garbage collection is incremental and periodic, so eligible CVRs are not necessarily purged immediately. flag: --cvr-garbage-collection-inactivity-threshold-hours env: ZERO_CVR_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_INACTIVITY_THRESHOLD_HOURS default: 48 CVR Garbage Collection Initial Batch Size The initial number of CVRs to purge per garbage collection interval. This number is increased linearly if the rate of new CVRs exceeds the rate of purged CVRs, in order to reach a steady state. Setting this to 0 effectively disables CVR garbage collection. flag: --cvr-garbage-collection-initial-batch-size env: ZERO_CVR_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_INITIAL_BATCH_SIZE default: 25 CVR Garbage Collection Initial Interval Seconds The initial interval at which to check and garbage collect inactive CVRs. This interval is increased exponentially (up to 16 minutes) when there is nothing to purge. flag: --cvr-garbage-collection-initial-interval-seconds env: ZERO_CVR_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_INITIAL_INTERVAL_SECONDS default: 60 CVR Max Connections The maximum number of connections to open to the CVR database. This is divided evenly amongst sync workers. Note that this number must allow for at least one connection per sync worker, or zero-cache will fail to start. See num-sync-workers. flag: --cvr-max-conns env: ZERO_CVR_MAX_CONNS default: 30 Enable Query Planner Enable the query planner for optimizing ZQL queries. The query planner analyzes and optimizes query execution by determining the most efficient join strategies. You can disable the planner if it is picking bad strategies. flag: --enable-query-planner env: ZERO_ENABLE_QUERY_PLANNER default: true Enable Telemetry Zero collects anonymous telemetry data to help us understand usage. We collect: Zero version Uptime General machine information, like the number of CPUs, OS, CI/CD environment, etc. Information about usage, such as number of queries or mutations processed per hour. This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time. You can also opt-out by setting DO_NOT_TRACK=1. flag: --enable-telemetry env: ZERO_ENABLE_TELEMETRY default: true Initial Sync Table Copy Workers The number of parallel workers used to copy tables during initial sync. Each worker uses a database connection, copies a single table at a time, and buffers up to (approximately) 10 MB of table data in memory during initial sync. Increasing the number of workers may improve initial sync speed; however, local disk throughput (IOPS), upstream CPU, and network bandwidth may also be bottlenecks. flag: --initial-sync-table-copy-workers env: ZERO_INITIAL_SYNC_TABLE_COPY_WORKERS default: 5 Lazy Startup Delay starting the majority of zero-cache until first request. This is mainly intended to avoid connecting to Postgres replication stream until the first request is received, which can be useful i.e., for preview instances. Currently only supported in single-node mode. flag: --lazy-startup env: ZERO_LAZY_STARTUP default: false Litestream Backup URL The location of the litestream backup, usually an s3:// URL. This is only consulted by the replication-manager. view-syncers receive this information from the replication-manager. In multi-node deployments, this is required on the replication-manager so view-syncers can reserve snapshots; in single-node deployments it is optional. flag: --litestream-backup-url env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_URL Litestream Checkpoint Threshold MB The size of the WAL file at which to perform an SQlite checkpoint to apply the writes in the WAL to the main database file. Each checkpoint creates a new WAL segment file that will be backed up by litestream. Smaller thresholds may improve read performance, at the expense of creating more files to download when restoring the replica from the backup. flag: --litestream-checkpoint-threshold-mb env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_CHECKPOINT_THRESHOLD_MB default: 40 Litestream Config Path Path to the litestream yaml config file. zero-cache will run this with its environment variables, which can be referenced in the file via ${ENV} substitution, for example: ZERO_REPLICA_FILE for the db Path ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_LOCATION for the db replica url ZERO_LITESTREAM_LOG_LEVEL for the log Level ZERO_LOG_FORMAT for the log type flag: --litestream-config-path env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_CONFIG_PATH default: ./src/services/litestream/config.yml Litestream Executable Path to the litestream executable. This option has no effect if litestream-backup-url is unspecified. flag: --litestream-executable env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_EXECUTABLE Litestream Incremental Backup Interval Minutes The interval between incremental backups of the replica. Shorter intervals reduce the amount of change history that needs to be replayed when catching up a new view-syncer, at the expense of increasing the number of files needed to download for the initial litestream restore. flag: --litestream-incremental-backup-interval-minutes env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_INCREMENTAL_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES default: 15 Litestream Maximum Checkpoint Page Count The WAL page count at which SQLite performs a RESTART checkpoint, which blocks writers until complete. Defaults to minCheckpointPageCount * 10. Set to 0 to disable RESTART checkpoints entirely. flag: --litestream-max-checkpoint-page-count env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_MAX_CHECKPOINT_PAGE_COUNT default: minCheckpointPageCount * 10 Litestream Minimum Checkpoint Page Count The WAL page count at which SQLite attempts a PASSIVE checkpoint, which transfers pages to the main database file without blocking writers. Defaults to checkpointThresholdMB * 250 (since SQLite page size is 4KB). flag: --litestream-min-checkpoint-page-count env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_MIN_CHECKPOINT_PAGE_COUNT default: checkpointThresholdMB * 250 Litestream Multipart Concurrency The number of parts (of size --litestream-multipart-size bytes) to upload or download in parallel when backing up or restoring the snapshot. flag: --litestream-multipart-concurrency env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_MULTIPART_CONCURRENCY default: 48 Litestream Multipart Size The size of each part when uploading or downloading the snapshot with --litestream-multipart-concurrency. Note that up to concurrency * size bytes of memory are used when backing up or restoring the snapshot. flag: --litestream-multipart-size env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_MULTIPART_SIZE default: 16777216 (16 MiB) Litestream Log Level flag: --litestream-log-level env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_LOG_LEVEL default: warn values: debug, info, warn, error Litestream Port Port on which litestream exports metrics, used to determine the replication watermark up to which it is safe to purge change log records. flag: --litestream-port env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_PORT default: --port + 2 Litestream Restore Parallelism The number of WAL files to download in parallel when performing the initial restore of the replica from the backup. flag: --litestream-restore-parallelism env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_RESTORE_PARALLELISM default: 48 Litestream Snapshot Backup Interval Hours The interval between snapshot backups of the replica. Snapshot backups make a full copy of the database to a new litestream generation. This improves restore time at the expense of bandwidth. Applications with a large database and low write rate can increase this interval to reduce network usage for backups (litestream defaults to 24 hours). flag: --litestream-snapshot-backup-interval-hours env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_SNAPSHOT_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS default: 12 Log Format Use text for developer-friendly console logging and json for consumption by structured-logging services. flag: --log-format env: ZERO_LOG_FORMAT default: \"text\" values: text, json Log IVM Sampling How often to collect IVM metrics. 1 out of N requests will be sampled where N is this value. flag: --log-ivm-sampling env: ZERO_LOG_IVM_SAMPLING default: 5000 Log Level Sets the logging level for the application. flag: --log-level env: ZERO_LOG_LEVEL default: \"info\" values: debug, info, warn, error Log Slow Hydrate Threshold The number of milliseconds a query hydration must take to print a slow warning. flag: --log-slow-hydrate-threshold env: ZERO_LOG_SLOW_HYDRATE_THRESHOLD default: 100 Log Slow Row Threshold The number of ms a row must take to fetch from table-source before it is considered slow. flag: --log-slow-row-threshold env: ZERO_LOG_SLOW_ROW_THRESHOLD default: 2 Mutate API Key An optional secret used to authorize zero-cache to call the API server handling writes. This is sent from zero-cache to your mutate endpoint in an X-Api-Key header. flag: --mutate-api-key env: ZERO_MUTATE_API_KEY Mutate Forward Cookies If true, zero-cache will forward cookies from the request to zero-cache to your mutate endpoint. This is useful for passing authentication cookies to the API server. If false, cookies are not forwarded. flag: --mutate-forward-cookies env: ZERO_MUTATE_FORWARD_COOKIES default: false Mutate URL The URL of the API server to which zero-cache will push mutations. URLs are matched using URLPattern, a standard Web API. Pattern syntax (similar to Express routes): Exact URL match: \"https://api.example.com/mutate\" Any subdomain using wildcard: \"https://*.example.com/mutate\" Multiple subdomain levels: \"https://*.*.example.com/mutate\" Any path under a domain: \"https://api.example.com/*\" Named path parameters: \"https://api.example.com/:version/mutate\" Matches https://api.example.com/v1/mutate, https://api.example.com/v2/mutate, etc. Advanced patterns: Optional path segments: \"https://api.example.com/:path?\" Regex in segments (for specific patterns): \"https://api.example.com/:version(v\\\\d+)/mutate\" matches only v followed by digits. Multiple patterns can be specified, for example: [\"https://api1.example.com/mutate\", \"https://api2.example.com/mutate\"] Query parameters and URL fragments (#) are ignored during matching. See URLPattern for full syntax. flag: --mutate-url env: ZERO_MUTATE_URL Number of Sync Workers The number of processes to use for view syncing. Leave this unset to use the maximum available parallelism. If set to 0, the server runs without sync workers, which is the configuration for running the replication-manager in multi-node deployments. flag: --num-sync-workers env: ZERO_NUM_SYNC_WORKERS Per User Mutation Limit Max The maximum mutations per user within the specified windowMs. flag: --per-user-mutation-limit-max env: ZERO_PER_USER_MUTATION_LIMIT_MAX Per User Mutation Limit Window (ms) The sliding window over which the perUserMutationLimitMax is enforced. flag: --per-user-mutation-limit-window-ms env: ZERO_PER_USER_MUTATION_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS default: 60000 Port The port for sync connections. flag: --port env: ZERO_PORT default: 4848 Query API Key An optional secret used to authorize zero-cache to call the API server handling queries. This is sent from zero-cache to your query endpoint in an X-Api-Key header. flag: --query-api-key env: ZERO_QUERY_API_KEY Query Forward Cookies If true, zero-cache will forward cookies from the request to zero-cache to your query endpoint. This is useful for passing authentication cookies to the API server. If false, cookies are not forwarded. flag: --query-forward-cookies env: ZERO_QUERY_FORWARD_COOKIES default: false Query Hydration Stats Track and log the number of rows considered by query hydrations which take longer than log-slow-hydrate-threshold milliseconds. This is useful for debugging and performance tuning. flag: --query-hydration-stats env: ZERO_QUERY_HYDRATION_STATS Query URL The URL of the API server to which zero-cache will send synced queries. URLs are matched using URLPattern, a standard Web API. Pattern syntax (similar to Express routes): Exact URL match: \"https://api.example.com/query\" Any subdomain using wildcard: \"https://*.example.com/query\" Multiple subdomain levels: \"https://*.*.example.com/query\" Any path under a domain: \"https://api.example.com/*\" Named path parameters: \"https://api.example.com/:version/query\" Matches https://api.example.com/v1/query, https://api.example.com/v2/query, etc. Advanced patterns: Optional path segments: \"https://api.example.com/:path?\" Regex in segments (for specific patterns): \"https://api.example.com/:version(v\\\\d+)/query\" matches only v followed by digits. Multiple patterns can be specified, for example: [\"https://api1.example.com/query\", \"https://api2.example.com/query\"] Query parameters and URL fragments (#) are ignored during matching. See URLPattern for full syntax. flag: --query-url env: ZERO_QUERY_URL Replica File File path to the SQLite replica that zero-cache maintains. This can be lost, but if it is, zero-cache will have to re-replicate next time it starts up. flag: --replica-file env: ZERO_REPLICA_FILE default: \"zero.db\" Replica Vacuum Interval Hours Performs a VACUUM at server startup if the specified number of hours has elapsed since the last VACUUM (or initial-sync). The VACUUM operation is heavyweight and requires double the size of the db in disk space. If unspecified, VACUUM operations are not performed. flag: --replica-vacuum-interval-hours env: ZERO_REPLICA_VACUUM_INTERVAL_HOURS Replica Page Cache Size KiB The SQLite page cache size in kibibytes (KiB) for view-syncer connections. The page cache stores recently accessed database pages in memory to reduce disk I/O. Larger cache sizes improve performance for workloads that fit in cache. If unspecified, SQLite's default (~2 MB) is used. Note that the effective memory use of this setting will be: 2 * cache_size * num_cores, as each connection to the replica gets its own cache and each core maintains 2 connections. flag: --replica-page-cache-size-kib env: ZERO_REPLICA_PAGE_CACHE_SIZE_KIB Server Version The version string outputted to logs when the server starts up. flag: --server-version env: ZERO_SERVER_VERSION Storage DB Temp Dir Temporary directory for IVM operator storage. Leave unset to use os.tmpdir(). flag: --storage-db-tmp-dir env: ZERO_STORAGE_DB_TMP_DIR Task ID Globally unique identifier for the zero-cache instance. Setting this to a platform specific task identifier can be useful for debugging. If unspecified, zero-cache will attempt to extract the TaskARN if run from within an AWS ECS container, and otherwise use a random string. flag: --task-id env: ZERO_TASK_ID Upstream Max Connections The maximum number of connections to open to the upstream database for committing mutations. This is divided evenly amongst sync workers. In addition to this number, zero-cache uses one connection for the replication stream. Note that this number must allow for at least one connection per sync worker, or zero-cache will fail to start. See num-sync-workers. flag: --upstream-max-conns env: ZERO_UPSTREAM_MAX_CONNS default: 20 Websocket Compression Enable WebSocket per-message deflate compression. Compression can reduce bandwidth usage for sync traffic but increases CPU usage on both client and server. Disabled by default. See: https://github.com/websockets/ws#websocket-compression flag: --websocket-compression env: ZERO_WEBSOCKET_COMPRESSION default: false Websocket Compression Options JSON string containing WebSocket compression options. Only used if websocket-compression is enabled. Example: {\"zlibDeflateOptions\":{\"level\":3},\"threshold\":1024}. See https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md#new-websocketserveroptions-callback for available options. flag: --websocket-compression-options env: ZERO_WEBSOCKET_COMPRESSION_OPTIONS Yield Threshold (ms) The maximum amount of time in milliseconds that a sync worker will spend in IVM (processing query hydration and advancement) before yielding to the event loop. Lower values increase responsiveness and fairness at the cost of reduced throughput. flag: --yield-threshold-ms env: ZERO_YIELD_THRESHOLD_MS default: 10 Deprecated Flags Auth JWK A public key in JWK format used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set. flag: --auth-jwk env: ZERO_AUTH_JWK Auth JWKS URL A URL that returns a JWK set used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set. flag: --auth-jwks-url env: ZERO_AUTH_JWKS_URL Auth Secret A symmetric key used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set. flag: --auth-secret env: ZERO_AUTH_SECRET",

    "content": "App ID Unique identifier for the app. Multiple zero-cache apps can run on a single upstream database, each of which is isolated from the others, with its own permissions, sharding (future feature), and change/cvr databases. The metadata of an app is stored in an upstream schema with the same name, e.g. zero, and the metadata for each app shard, e.g. client and mutation ids, is stored in the {app-id}_{#} schema. (Currently there is only a single \"0\" shard, but this will change with sharding). The CVR and Change data are managed in schemas named {app-id}_{shard-num}/cvr and {app-id}_{shard-num}/cdc, respectively, allowing multiple apps and shards to share the same database instance (e.g. a Postgres \"cluster\") for CVR and Change management. Due to constraints on replication slot names, an App ID may only consist of lower-case letters, numbers, and the underscore character. Note that this option is used by both zero-cache and zero-deploy-permissions. flag: --app-id env: ZERO_APP_ID default: zero App Publications Postgres PUBLICATIONs that define the tables and columns to replicate. Publication names may not begin with an underscore, as zero reserves that prefix for internal use. If unspecified, zero-cache will create and use an internal publication that publishes all tables in the public schema, i.e.: CREATE PUBLICATION _{app-id}_public_0 FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA public; Note that changing the set of publications will result in resyncing the replica, which may involve downtime (replication lag) while the new replica is initializing. To change the set of publications without disrupting an existing app, a new app should be created. flag: --app-publications env: ZERO_APP_PUBLICATIONS default: [] Auto Reset Automatically wipe and resync the replica when replication is halted. This situation can occur for configurations in which the upstream database provider prohibits event trigger creation, preventing the zero-cache from being able to correctly replicate schema changes. For such configurations, an upstream schema change will instead result in halting replication with an error indicating that the replica needs to be reset. When auto-reset is enabled, zero-cache will respond to such situations by shutting down, and when restarted, resetting the replica and all synced clients. This is a heavy-weight operation and can result in user-visible slowness or downtime if compute resources are scarce. flag: --auto-reset env: ZERO_AUTO_RESET default: true Change DB The Postgres database used to store recent replication log entries, in order to sync multiple view-syncers without requiring multiple replication slots on the upstream database. If unspecified, the upstream-db will be used. flag: --change-db env: ZERO_CHANGE_DB Change Max Connections The maximum number of connections to open to the change database. This is used by the change-streamer for catching up zero-cache replication subscriptions. flag: --change-max-conns env: ZERO_CHANGE_MAX_CONNS default: 5 Change Streamer Mode The mode for running or connecting to the change-streamer: dedicated: runs the change-streamer and shuts down when another change-streamer takes over the replication slot. This is appropriate in a single-node configuration, or for the replication-manager in a multi-node configuration. discover: connects to the change-streamer as internally advertised in the change-db. This is appropriate for the view-syncers in a multi-node setup. This may not work in all networking configurations (e.g., some private networking or port forwarding setups). Using ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI with an explicit routable hostname is recommended instead. This option is ignored if ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI is set. flag: --change-streamer-mode env: ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_MODE default: dedicated Change Streamer Port The port on which the change-streamer runs. This is an internal protocol between the replication-manager and view-syncers, which runs in the same process tree in local development or a single-node configuration. If unspecified, defaults to --port + 1. flag: --change-streamer-port env: ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_PORT default: --port + 1 Change Streamer Startup Delay (ms) The delay to wait before the change-streamer takes over the replication stream (i.e. the handoff during replication-manager updates), to allow load balancers to register the task as healthy based on healthcheck parameters.

You can disable the planner if it is picking bad strategies. flag: --enable-query-planner env: ZERO_ENABLE_QUERY_PLANNER default: true Enable Telemetry Zero collects anonymous telemetry data to help us understand usage. We collect: Zero version Uptime General machine information, like the number of CPUs, OS, CI/CD environment, etc. Information about usage, such as number of queries or mutations processed per hour. This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time. You can also opt-out by setting DO_NOT_TRACK=1. flag: --enable-telemetry env: ZERO_ENABLE_TELEMETRY default: true Initial Sync Table Copy Workers The number of parallel workers used to copy tables during initial sync. Each worker uses a database connection, copies a single table at a time, and buffers up to (approximately) 10 MB of table data in memory during initial sync. Increasing the number of workers may improve initial sync speed; however, local disk throughput (IOPS), upstream CPU, and network bandwidth may also be bottlenecks. flag: --initial-sync-table-copy-workers env: ZERO_INITIAL_SYNC_TABLE_COPY_WORKERS default: 5 Lazy Startup Delay starting the majority of zero-cache until first request. This is mainly intended to avoid connecting to Postgres replication stream until the first request is received, which can be useful i.e., for preview instances. Currently only supported in single-node mode. flag: --lazy-startup env: ZERO_LAZY_STARTUP default: false Litestream Backup URL The location of the litestream backup, usually an s3:// URL. This is only consulted by the replication-manager. view-syncers receive this information from the replication-manager. In multi-node deployments, this is required on the replication-manager so view-syncers can reserve snapshots; in single-node deployments it is optional. flag: --litestream-backup-url env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_URL Litestream Checkpoint Threshold MB The size of the WAL file at which to perform an SQlite checkpoint to apply the writes in the WAL to the main database file. Each checkpoint creates a new WAL segment file that will be backed up by litestream. Smaller thresholds may improve read performance, at the expense of creating more files to download when restoring the replica from the backup. flag: --litestream-checkpoint-threshold-mb env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_CHECKPOINT_THRESHOLD_MB default: 40 Litestream Config Path Path to the litestream yaml config file. zero-cache will run this with its environment variables, which can be referenced in the file via ${ENV} substitution, for example: ZERO_REPLICA_FILE for the db Path ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_LOCATION for the db replica url ZERO_LITESTREAM_LOG_LEVEL for the log Level ZERO_LOG_FORMAT for the log type flag: --litestream-config-path env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_CONFIG_PATH default: ./src/services/litestream/config.yml Litestream Executable Path to the litestream executable.

Shorter intervals reduce the amount of change history that needs to be replayed when catching up a new view-syncer, at the expense of increasing the number of files needed to download for the initial litestream restore. flag: --litestream-incremental-backup-interval-minutes env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_INCREMENTAL_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES default: 15 Litestream Maximum Checkpoint Page Count The WAL page count at which SQLite performs a RESTART checkpoint, which blocks writers until complete. Defaults to minCheckpointPageCount * 10. Set to 0 to disable RESTART checkpoints entirely. flag: --litestream-max-checkpoint-page-count env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_MAX_CHECKPOINT_PAGE_COUNT default: minCheckpointPageCount * 10 Litestream Minimum Checkpoint Page Count The WAL page count at which SQLite attempts a PASSIVE checkpoint, which transfers pages to the main database file without blocking writers.

Note that up to concurrency * size bytes of memory are used when backing up or restoring the snapshot. flag: --litestream-multipart-size env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_MULTIPART_SIZE default: 16777216 (16 MiB) Litestream Log Level flag: --litestream-log-level env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_LOG_LEVEL default: warn values: debug, info, warn, error Litestream Port Port on which litestream exports metrics, used to determine the replication watermark up to which it is safe to purge change log records. flag: --litestream-port env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_PORT default: --port + 2 Litestream Restore Parallelism The number of WAL files to download in parallel when performing the initial restore of the replica from the backup. flag: --litestream-restore-parallelism env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_RESTORE_PARALLELISM default: 48 Litestream Snapshot Backup Interval Hours The interval between snapshot backups of the replica. Snapshot backups make a full copy of the database to a new litestream generation. This improves restore time at the expense of bandwidth. Applications with a large database and low write rate can increase this interval to reduce network usage for backups (litestream defaults to 24 hours). flag: --litestream-snapshot-backup-interval-hours env: ZERO_LITESTREAM_SNAPSHOT_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS default: 12 Log Format Use text for developer-friendly console logging and json for consumption by structured-logging services. flag: --log-format env: ZERO_LOG_FORMAT default: \"text\" values: text, json Log IVM Sampling How often to collect IVM metrics. 1 out of N requests will be sampled where N is this value. flag: --log-ivm-sampling env: ZERO_LOG_IVM_SAMPLING default: 5000 Log Level Sets the logging level for the application. flag: --log-level env: ZERO_LOG_LEVEL default: \"info\" values: debug, info, warn, error Log Slow Hydrate Threshold The number of milliseconds a query hydration must take to print a slow warning. flag: --log-slow-hydrate-threshold env: ZERO_LOG_SLOW_HYDRATE_THRESHOLD default: 100 Log Slow Row Threshold The number of ms a row must take to fetch from table-source before it is considered slow. flag: --log-slow-row-threshold env: ZERO_LOG_SLOW_ROW_THRESHOLD default: 2 Mutate API Key An optional secret used to authorize zero-cache to call the API server handling writes.

The VACUUM operation is heavyweight and requires double the size of the db in disk space. If unspecified, VACUUM operations are not performed. flag: --replica-vacuum-interval-hours env: ZERO_REPLICA_VACUUM_INTERVAL_HOURS Replica Page Cache Size KiB The SQLite page cache size in kibibytes (KiB) for view-syncer connections. The page cache stores recently accessed database pages in memory to reduce disk I/O. Larger cache sizes improve performance for workloads that fit in cache. If unspecified, SQLite's default (~2 MB) is used. Note that the effective memory use of this setting will be: 2 * cache_size * num_cores, as each connection to the replica gets its own cache and each core maintains 2 connections. flag: --replica-page-cache-size-kib env: ZERO_REPLICA_PAGE_CACHE_SIZE_KIB Server Version The version string outputted to logs when the server starts up. flag: --server-version env: ZERO_SERVER_VERSION Storage DB Temp Dir Temporary directory for IVM operator storage.

    "searchTitle": "ZQL",
    "url": "/docs/zql",
    "content": "Inspired by SQL, ZQL is expressed in TypeScript with heavy use of the builder pattern. If you have used Drizzle or Kysely, ZQL will feel familiar. ZQL queries are composed of one or more clauses that are chained together into a query. Create a Builder To get started, use createBuilder. If you use drizzle-zero or prisma-zero, this happens automatically and an instance is stored in the zql constant exported from schema.ts: import {zql} from 'schema.ts' // zql.myTable.where(...) Otherwise, create an instance manually: // schema.ts // ... export const zql = createBuilder(schema) Select ZQL queries start by selecting a table. There is no way to select a subset of columns; ZQL queries always return the entire row, if permissions allow it. import {zql} from 'zero.ts' // Returns a query that selects all rows and columns from the // issue table. zql.issue This is a design tradeoff that allows Zero to better reuse the row locally for future queries. This also makes it easier to share types between different parts of the code. This means you should not modify the data directly. Instead, clone the data and modify the clone. ZQL caches values and returns them multiple times. If you modify a value returned from ZQL, you will modify it everywhere it is used. This can lead to subtle bugs. JavaScript and TypeScript lack true immutable types so we use readonly to help enforce it. But it's easy to cast away the readonly accidentally. Ordering You can sort query results by adding an orderBy clause: zql.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc') Multiple orderBy clauses can be present, in which case the data is sorted by those clauses in order: // Order by priority descending. For any rows with same priority, // then order by created desc. zql.issue .orderBy('priority', 'desc') .orderBy('created', 'desc') All queries in ZQL have a default final order of their primary key. Assuming the issue table has a primary key on the id column, then: // Actually means: zql.issue.orderBy('id', 'asc'); zql.issue // Actually means: zql.issue.orderBy('priority', 'desc').orderBy('id', 'asc'); zql.issue.orderBy('priority', 'desc') Limit You can limit the number of rows to return with limit(): zql.issue.orderBy('created', 'desc').limit(100) Paging You can start the results at or after a particular row with start(): let start: IssueRow | undefined while (true) { let q = zql.issue .orderBy('created', 'desc') .limit(100) if (start) { q = q.start(start) } const batch = await q.run() console.log('got batch', batch) if (batch.length < 100) { break } start = batch[batch.length - 1] } By default start() is exclusive - it returns rows starting after the supplied reference row. This is what you usually want for paging. If you want inclusive results, you can do: zql.issue.start(row, {inclusive: true}) Getting a Single Result If you want exactly zero or one results, use the one() clause. This causes ZQL to return Row|undefined rather than Row[]. const result = await zql.issue .where('id', 42) .one() .run() if (!result) { console.error('not found') } one() overrides any limit() clause that is also present. Relationships You can query related rows using relationships that are defined in your Zero schema. // Get all issues and their related comments zql.issue.related('comments') Relationships are returned as hierarchical data. In the above example, each row will have a comments field, which is an array of the corresponding comments rows. You can fetch multiple relationships in a single query: zql.issue .related('comments') .related('reactions') .related('assignees') Refining Relationships By default all matching relationship rows are returned, but this can be refined. The related method accepts an optional second function which is itself a query. zql.issue.related( 'comments', // It is common to use the 'q' shorthand variable for this parameter, // but it is a _comment_ query in particular here, exactly as if you // had done zql.comment. q => q .orderBy('modified', 'desc') .limit(100) .start(lastSeenComment) ) This relationship query can have all the same clauses that top-level queries can have. Using orderBy or limit in a relationship that goes through a junction table (i.e., a many-to-many relationship) is not currently supported and will throw a runtime error. See bug 3527. You can sometimes work around this by making the junction relationship explicit, depending on your schema and usage. Nested Relationships You can nest relationships arbitrarily: // Get all issues, first 100 comments for each (ordered by modified,desc), // and for each comment all of its reactions. zql.issue.related('comments', q => q .orderBy('modified', 'desc') .limit(100) .related('reactions') ) Where You can filter a query with where(): zql.issue.where('priority', '=', 'high') The first parameter is always a column name from the table being queried. TypeScript completion will offer available options (sourced from your Zero Schema). Comparison Operators Where supports the following comparison operators: TypeScript will restrict you from using operators with types that don’t make sense – you can’t use > with boolean for example. If you don’t see the comparison operator you need, let us know, many are easy to add. Equals is the Default Comparison Operator Because comparing by = is so common, you can leave it out and where defaults to =. zql.issue.where('priority', 'high') Comparing to null As in SQL, ZQL’s null cannot be compared with =, !=, <, or any other normal comparison operator. Comparing any value to null with such operators is always false: These semantics feel a bit weird, but they are consistent with SQL. The reason SQL does it this way is to make join semantics work: if you’re joining employee.orgID on org.id you do not want an employee in no organization to match an org that hasn’t yet been assigned an ID. For when you purposely do want to compare to null ZQL supports IS and IS NOT operators that also work just like in SQL: // Find employees not in any org. zql.employee.where('orgID', 'IS', null) // Find employees in an org other than 42 OR employees in NO org zql.employee.where('orgID', 'IS NOT', 42) TypeScript will prevent you from comparing to null with other operators. Compound Filters The argument to where can also be a callback that returns a complex expression: // Get all issues that have priority 'critical' or else have both // priority 'medium' and not more than 100 votes. zql.issue.where(({cmp, and, or, not}) => or( cmp('priority', 'critical'), and( cmp('priority', 'medium'), not(cmp('numVotes', '>', 100)) ) ) ) cmp is short for compare and works the same as where at the top-level except that it can’t be chained and it only accepts comparison operators (no relationship filters – see below). Note that chaining where() is also a one-level and: // Find issues with priority 3 or higher, owned by aa zql.issue .where('priority', '>=', 3) .where('owner', 'aa') Comparing Literal Values The where clause always expects its first parameter to be a column name as a string. Same with the cmp helper: // \"foo\" is a column name, not a string: zql.issue.where('foo', 'bar') // \"foo\" is a column name, not a string: zql.issue.where(({cmp}) => cmp('foo', 'bar')) To compare to a literal value, use the cmpLit helper: zql.issue.where(cmpLit('foobar', 'foo' + 'bar')) This is particularly useful for implementing permissions, because the first parameter can be a field of your context: zql.issue.where(cmpLit(ctx.role, 'admin')) Relationship Filters Your filter can also test properties of relationships. Currently the only supported test is existence: // Find all orgs that have at least one employee zql.organization.whereExists('employees') The argument to whereExists is a relationship, so just like other relationships, it can be refined with a query: // Find all orgs that have at least one cool employee zql.organization.whereExists('employees', q => q.where('location', 'Hawaii') ) As with querying relationships, relationship filters can be arbitrarily nested: // Get all issues that have comments that have reactions zql.issue.whereExists('comments', q => q.whereExists('reactions') ) The exists helper is also provided which can be used with and, or, cmp, and not to build compound filters that check relationship existence: // Find issues that have at least one comment or are high priority zql.issue.where({cmp, or, exists} => or( cmp('priority', 'high'), exists('comments'), ), ) Type Helpers You can get the TypeScript type of the result of a query using the QueryResultType helper: import type {QueryResultType} from '@rocicorp/zero' const complexQuery = zql.issue.related( 'comments', q => q.related('author') ) type MyComplexResult = QueryResultType<typeof complexQuery> // MyComplexResult is: readonly IssueRow & { // readonly comments: readonly (CommentRow & { // readonly author: readonly AuthorRow|undefined; // })[]; // }[] You can get the type of a single row with QueryRowType: import type {QueryRowType} from '@rocicorp/zero' type MySingleRow = QueryRowType<typeof complexQuery> // MySingleRow is: readonly IssueRow & { // readonly comments: readonly (CommentRow & { // readonly author: readonly AuthorRow|undefined; // })[]; // } Planning Zero automatically plans queries, selecting the best indexes and join orders in most cases. Inspecting Query Plans You can inspect the plan that Zero generates for any ZQL query using the inspector. Manually Flipping Joins The process Zero uses to optimize joins is called \"join flipping\", because it involves \"flipping\" the order of joins to minimize the number of rows processed. Typically the Zero planner will pick the joins to flip automatically. But in some rare cases, you may want to manually specify the join order. This can be done by passing the flip:true option to whereExists: // Find the first 100 documents that user 42 can edit, // ordered by created desc. Because each user is an editor // of only a few documents, flip:true is much faster than // flip:false. zql.documents.whereExists('editors', e => e.where('userID', 42), {flip: true} ), .orderBy('created', 'desc') .limit(100) Or with exists: // Find issues created by user 42 or that have a comment // by user 42. Because user 42 has commented on only a // few issues, flip:true is much faster than flip:false. zql.issue.where({cmp, or, exists} => or( cmp('creatorID', 42), exists('comments', c => c.where('creatorID', 42), {flip: true}), ), ) You can manually flip just one or a few of the whereExists clauses in a query, leaving the rest to be planned automatically.",

    "content": "As in SQL, ZQL’s null cannot be compared with =, !=, <, or any other normal comparison operator. Comparing any value to null with such operators is always false: These semantics feel a bit weird, but they are consistent with SQL. The reason SQL does it this way is to make join semantics work: if you’re joining employee.orgID on org.id you do not want an employee in no organization to match an org that hasn’t yet been assigned an ID. For when you purposely do want to compare to null ZQL supports IS and IS NOT operators that also work just like in SQL: // Find employees not in any org. zql.employee.where('orgID', 'IS', null) // Find employees in an org other than 42 OR employees in NO org zql.employee.where('orgID', 'IS NOT', 42) TypeScript will prevent you from comparing to null with other operators.",
