## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.11
```

## Features

- Windows should work a lot better now. Thank you very much to [aexylus](https://aexylus.com/) and [Sergio Leon](https://www.cbnsndwch.io/) for the testing and contributions here.
- Support nested property access in JWT auth tokens ([docs](/docs/permissions#rules)). 
- Make initial sync configurable ([docs](/docs/zero-cache-config#initial-sync-table-copy-workers)).
- Add query result type to SolidJS ([docs](/docs/reading-data#completeness))
- Docker image now contains native amd64 and arm64 binaries.
- Add `storageKey` constructor parameter to enable multiple `Zero` instances for same `userID`.

## Fixes

Many, many fixes, including:

- Fix downstream replication of primitive values
- Fix replication of `TRUNCATE` messages
- Fix large storage use for idle pg instances
- Add runtime sanity checks for when a table is referenced but not synced
- Fix `zero-cache-dev` for multitenant


## Breaking Changes

- The addition of result types to SolidJS is a breaking API change on SolidJS only. See the changes to [`hello-zero-solid`](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/commit/7c6c3a47479f037f8323b102013244881c74fe9e) for upgrade example.
