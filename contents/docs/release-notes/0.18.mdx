## Install

npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.18
```

## Upgrading

To try out custom mutators, see the changes to [hello-zero-solid](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/pull/17).

## Features

- Custom Mutators! Finally! Define arbitrary write operations in code ([doc](/docs/writing-data)).
- Added inspector API for debugging sync, queries, and client storage ([doc](/docs/debug/inspector)).
- Added `analyze-query` tool to debug query performance ([doc](/docs/debug/slow-queries#query-plan)).
- Added `transform-query` tool to debug permissions ([doc](/docs/debug/permissions#read-permissions)).
- Added `ast-to-zql` script to prettify Zero's internal AST format ([doc](/docs/debug/query-asts)).

## Fixes

- Added backpressure to `replication-manager` to protect against Postgres moving faster than we can push to clients ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4089)).
- `@rocicorp/zero/advanced` has been deprecated. `AdvancedQuery` got folded into `Query` and `ZeroAdvancedOptions` got folded into `ZeroOptions` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4086)).
- Support `ALTER SCHEMA` DDL changes ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4098))
- Allow `replication-manager` to continue running while a new one re-replicates. ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4124)).
- Improve replication performance for some schema changes ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4151)).
- Make the log level of `zero-deploy-permissions` configurable ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4002))
- Bind `exists` to the expression builder ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4010))
- Fix `single output already exists` error ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4020))
- Fix `getBrowserGlobal('window')?.addEventListener not a function` in Expo (thanks `@andrewcoelho`!) ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4037)).
- Fix Vue bindings ref counting bug. Bindings no longer need to pass `RefCountMap` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4013)).
- Fix CVR ownership takeover race conditions ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4071)).
- Support `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` in degraded-mode pg providers ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4131)).
- Handle corrupt sqlite db by re-replicating ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4133)).
- Don't send useless pokes to clients that are unchanged ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4149)).
- Add `limit(1)` to queries using a relation that is marked `one()` ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4154)).
- Export `UseQueryOptions`
