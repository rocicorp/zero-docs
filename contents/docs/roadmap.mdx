title: Roadmap
---

## Alpha (EOY ‘24)

- ~~Schema migration~~
- ~~Write permissions~~
- ~~Solid support~~
- ~~Replica sqlite files not browsable with standard sqlite3 program~~
- ~~Relationship filters - currently you can put relationships in the ‘select’ part of the query, but not the ‘where’ part. Relationship filters commonly needed to, i.e., find all issues with particular label.~~
- ~~Multi-column primary keys~~
- ~~Read permissions~~
- ~~Docs for easily deploying Zero on your own AWS or Fly.io account~~
- ~~Up to 20MB client-side and 1GB server-side per-replica~~

## Beta (Q2 ‘25)

- ~~Custom mutators~~
- Cell-level read permissions (already exist for write)
- First-class support for React Native
- ~~Ability to wait for authoritative results~~
- Aggregations (count, sum, min, max, group-by, etc)
- Consistency.
  - See: [Consistency](/docs/reading-data#consistency).
  - This will also improve startup perf since apps won’t have to be so conservative in what they preload:
    ~~Cache size management: evict things from client-side cache to stay under size~~
- Reduce zero client bundle size to < 40KB
- Up to 20 MB client-side and 100 GB server-side per-replica

## GA

- Vector-based text search
- Extensive testing using randomized query generation and dst
- External audit of design and impl
- Ability to lock queries down to only expected forms for security
- Additional databases beside Postgres
- SaaS
