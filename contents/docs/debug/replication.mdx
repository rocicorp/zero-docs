## Resetting

During development we all do strange things (unsafely changing schemas, removing files, etc.). If the replica ever gets wedged (stops replicating, acts strange) you can wipe it and start over.

- If you copied your setup from `hello-zero` or `hello-zero-solid`, you can also run `npm run dev:clean`
- Otherwise you can run `rm /tmp/my-zero-replica.db*` (see your `.env` file for the replica file location) to clear the contents of the replica.

It is always safe to wipe the replica. Wiping will have no impact on your upstream database. Downstream zero-clients will get re-synced when they connect.

## Inspecting

For data to be synced to the client it must first be replicated to `zero-cache`. You can check the contents of `zero-cache` via:

```bash
$ npx zero-sqlite3 /tmp/my-zero-replica.db
```

This will drop you into a `sqlite3` shell with which you can use to explore the contents of the replica.

```sql
sqlite> .tables
_zero.changeLog          emoji                    viewState
_zero.replicationConfig  issue                    zero.permissions
_zero.replicationState   issueLabel               zero.schemaVersions
_zero.runtimeEvents      label                    zero_0.clients
_zero.versionHistory     user
comment                  userPref
sqlite> .mode qbox
sqlite> SELECT * FROM label;
┌─────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┬────────────┐

```

## Miscellaneous

If you see `FATAL:  sorry, too many clients already` in logs, it’s because you have two zero-cache instances running against dev. One is probably in a background tab somewhere. In production, `zero-cache` can run horizontally scaled but on dev it doesn’t run in the config that allows that.
