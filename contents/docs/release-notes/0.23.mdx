## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.23
```

## Upgrading

For example upgrades, see [ztunes](https://github.com/rocicorp/ztunes/pull/18) or [hello-zero-solid](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid/pull/26).

Please note the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) below. They are minor this time.

To try synced queries, please refer to the [docs](/docs/synced-queries), or the [zslack](https://github.com/rocicorp/zslack) / [hello-zero-solid](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero-solid) repos which have sample implementations. We will update the rest of the samples to synced queries and custom mutators in September.

## Features

- Synced Queries (previously known as "custom queries") ([docs](/docs/synced-queries)).
- First-class React Native support (thanks [Austin](https://github.com/austinm911) and [Chase](https://x.com/0xcadams)) ([docs](/docs/react-native)).
- New _"zslack"_ sample featuring React Native and Synced Queries ([doc](/docs/samples#zslack)).
- PlanetScale for Postgres is now fully supported ([docs](/docs/connecting-to-postgres)).
- Suspense support for React (thanks [Lewis](https://x.com/lewisl9029)) ([docs](/docs/react#suspense)).
- Flag to disable CRUD mutators ([docs](/docs/custom-mutators#disabling-crud-mutators)).
- New query metrics in inspector ([docs](/docs/debug/inspector#query-metrics)).

## Fixes

- Large connection headers should not throw ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4720)).
- Remove verbose stats from `/statz` that were crashing larger instances ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4719)).
- Fix `zero-sqlite3` in Docker container ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4739)).
- GC inactive CVRs ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4741)).
- Refuse or halt replication for unsupported replica identities ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4775)).
- Disable DB-level `statement_timeout` for `zero-cache` connections ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4811)).
- Handle resync after partial state drop ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/48141)).
- Fix logging color output on light terminals ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4056)).
- Use `TableSource` with `analyze-query` to better match production ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4822)).
- `zero-cache` now logs its version on startup ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4734)).
- "Go to definition" works on custom mutators if you set [`enableLegacyMutators: false`](/docs/custom-mutators#disabling-crud-mutators) ([bug](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3830)).

## zbugs

- zbugs now supports image uploads! ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4724)).

## Breaking Changes

- `ZeroProvider` now required in SolidJS, just like in React ([docs](/docs/solidjs#setup), [PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4692)).
- The `tx` parameter in custom mutators now requires an explicit type ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4703)).
- The `CustomMutatorDefs` type no longer accepts template parameters ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4703))
- The `delegate()` method on the `Query` class was removed. Use [`zero.run`, `zero.preload`, or `zero.materialize`](/docs/synced-queries#invoking-queries) instead ([PR](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/4806)).
