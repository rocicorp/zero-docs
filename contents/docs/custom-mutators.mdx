title: Custom Mutators
---

*Custom Mutators* are a new way to write data in Zero that is much more powerful than the original ["CRUD" mutator API](./writing-data).

Instead of having only the few built-in `insert`/`update`/`delete` write operations for each table, custom mutators *allow you to create your own write operations* using arbitrary code. This makes it possible to do things that are impossible or awkward with other sync engines.

For example, you can create custom mutators that:

* Perform arbitrary server-side validation
* Enforce fine-grained permissions
* Send email notifications
* Query LLMs
* Use Yjs for collaborative editing
* â€¦ and much, *much* more â€“ custom mutators are just code, and they can do anything code can do!

Despite their increased power, custom mutators still participate fully in sync. They execute instantly on the local device, immediately updating all active queries. They are then synced in the background to the server and to other clients.

<Note heading="Custom mutators will eventually become Zero's only write API">
We're still refining the design of custom mutators. During this phase, the old CRUD mutators will continue to work. But we do want to deprecate CRUD mutators, and eventually remove them. So please try out custom mutators and [let us know](https://discord.rocicorp.dev/) how they work for you, and what improvements you need before the cutover.
</Note>

## Understanding Custom Mutators

### Architecture

Custom mutators introduce a new *server* component to the Zero architecture.

![diagram](/images/custom-mutators/overview.png)

This server is implemented by you, the developer. It's typically just your existing backend, where you already put auth or other server-side functionality.

The server can be a serverless function, a microservice, or a full stateful server. The only real requirment is that it expose a special *push endpoint* that `zero-cache` can call to process mutations. This endpoint implements the [push protocol](#custom-push-implementation) and contains your custom logic for each mutation.

Zero provides utilities in `@rocicorp/zero` that make it really easy implement this endpoint in TypeScript. But you can also implement it yourself if you want. As long as your endpoint fulfills the push protocol, `zero-cache` doesn't care. You can even write it in a different programming language.

### What Even is a Mutator?

Zero's custom mutators are based on [*server reconciliation*](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html) â€“ a technique for robust sync that has been used by the video game industry for decades.

<Note emoji="ðŸŒˆ" heading="The more you know">
Our previous sync engine, [Replicache](https://replicache.dev/), also used server reconciliation. The ability to implement arbitrary mutators was one of Replicache's most popular features. Custom mutators bring this same power to Zero, but with a *much* better developer experience.
</Note>

A custom mutator is just a function that runs within a database transaction, and which can read and write to the database. Here's an example of a very simple custom mutator written in TypeScript:

```ts
async function updateIssue(tx: Transaction,
    {id, title}: {id: string, title: string}) {
  // Validate title length.
  if (title.length > 100) {
    throw new Error(`Title is too long`);
  }

  await tx.mutate.issue.update({id, title});
}
```

Each custom mutator gets **two implementations**: one on the client and one on the server.

The client implementation must be written in TypeScript against the Zero `Transaction` interface, using [ZQL](#read-data-on-the-client) for reads and a [CRUD-style API](#write-data-on-the-client) for writes.

The server implementation runs on your server, in your push endpoint, against your database. In principle, it can be written in any language and use any data access library. For example you could have the following Go-based server implementation of the same mutator:

```go
func updateIssueOnServer(tx *sql.Tx, id string, title string) error {
  // Validate title length.
  if len(title) > 100 {
    return errors.New("Title is too long")
  }

  _, err := tx.Exec("UPDATE issue SET title = $1 WHERE id = $2", title, id)
  return err
}
```

In practice however, most Zero apps use TypeScript on the server. For these users we provide a handy `ServerTransaction` that implements ZQL against Postgres, so that you can share code between client and server mutators naturally.

So on a TypeScript server, that server mutator can just be:

```ts
async function updateIssueOnServer(tx: ServerTransaction,
    {id, title}, {id: string, title: string}) {
  // Delegate to client mutator.
  // The `ServerTransaction` here has a different implementation
  // that runs the same ZQL queries against Postgres!
  await updateIssue(tx, {id, title});
}
```

<Note heading="Code sharing in mutators is optional">
Even in TypeScript, you can do as little or as much code sharing as you like. In your server mutator, you can [use raw SQL](TODO), any data access libraries you prefer, or add as much extra server-specific logic as you need.

Reusing ZQL on the server is a handy â€“ and we expect frequently used â€“ option, but not a requirement.
</Note>

### Server Authority

You may be wondering what happens if the client and server mutators implementations don't match.

Zero is an example of a _server-authoritative_ sync engine. This means that the server mutator always takes precedence over the client mutator. The result from the client mutator is considered *speculative* and is discarded as soon as the result from the server mutator is known. This is a very useful feature: it enables server-side validation, permissions, and other server-specific logic.

Imagine that you wanted to use an LLM to detect whether an issue update is spammy, rather than a simple length check. We can just add that to our server mutator:

```ts
async function updateIssueOnServer(tx: ServerTransaction,
    {id, title}: {id: string, title: string}) {
  const response = await llamaSession.prompt(
      `Is this title update likely spam?\n\n${title}\n\nResponse "yes" or "no"`);
  if (/yes/i.test(response)) {
    throw new Error(`Title is likely spam`);
  }

  // delegate rest of implementation to client mutator
  await updateIssue(tx, {id, title});
}
```

If the server detects that the mutation is spammy, the client will see the error message and the mutation will be rolled back. If the server mutator succeeds, the client mutator will be rolled back and the server result will be applied.

### Life of a Mutation

Now that we understand what client and server mutations are, let's walk through they work together with Zero to sync changes from a source client to the server and then other clients:

1. When you call a custom mutator on the client, Zero runs your client-side mutator immediately on the local device, updating all active queries instantly.
2. In the background, Zero then sends a *mutation* (a record of the mutator having run with certain arguments) to your server's push endpoint.
3. Your push endpoint runs the [push protocol](#custom-push-implementation), executing the server-side mutator in a transaction against your database and recording the fact that the mutation ran.
4. The changes to the database are replicated to `zero-cache` as normal.
5. `zero-cache` calculates the updates to active queries and sends rows that have changed to each client. It also sends information about the mutations that have been applied to the database.
6. Clients receive row updates and apply them to their local cache. Any pending mutations which have been applied to the server have their local effects rolled back.
7. Client-side queries are updated and the user sees the changes.

## Using Custom Mutators

### Registering Client Mutators

By convention, the client mutators are defined with a function called `createMutators` in a file called `mutators.ts`:

```ts
// mutators.ts
import { CustomMutatorDefs } from "@rocicorp/zero";
import { schema } from "./schema";

export function createMutators() {
  return {
    issue: {
      update: async (tx, {id, title}: { id: string; title: string }) => {
        // Validate title length. Legacy issues are exempt.
        if (e.length > 100) {
          throw new Error(`Title is too long`);
        }
        await tx.mutate.issue.update({id, title});
      },
    }
  } as const satisfies CustomMutatorDefs<typeof schema>;
}
```

The `mutators.ts` convention allows mutator implementations to be easily [reused server-side](#setting-up-the-server). The `createMutators` function convention is used so that we can pass authentication information in to [implement permissions](#permissions).

You are free to make different code layout choices â€“ the only real requirement is that you register your map of mutators in the `Zero` constructor:

```ts
// main.tsx
import { Zero } from "@rocicorp/zero";
import { schema } from "./schema";
import { createMutators } from "./mutators";

const zero = new Zero({
  schema,
  mutators: createMutators(),
});
```

### Write Data on the Client

The `Transaction` interface passed to client mutators exposes the same `mutate` API as the existing [CRUD-style mutators](./writing-data):

```ts
async function myMutator(tx: Transaction) {
  // Insert a new issue
  await tx.mutate.issue.insert({
    id: 'issue-123',
    title: 'New title',
    description: 'New description',
  });

  // Upsert a new issue
  await tx.mutate.issue.upsert({
    id: 'issue-123',
    title: 'New title',
    description: 'New description',
  });

  // Update an issue
  await tx.mutate.issue.update({
    id: 'issue-123',
    title: 'New title',
  });

  // Delete an issue
  await tx.mutate.issue.delete({
    id: 'issue-123',
  });
}
```

See [the CRUD docs](./writing-data) for detailed semantics on these methods.

### Read Data on the Client

You can read data within a client mutator using [ZQL](./reading-data):

```ts
export function createMutators() {
  return {
    issue: {
      update: async (tx, {id, title}: { id: string; title: string }) => {
        // Read existing issue
        const prev = await tx.query.issue.where('id', id).one().run();

        // Validate title length. Legacy issues are exempt.
        if (!prev.isLegacy && title.length > 100) {
          throw new Error(`Title is too long`);
        }

        await tx.mutate.issue.update({id, title});
      },
    }
  } as const satisfies CustomMutatorDefs<typeof schema>;
}
```

You have the full power of ZQL at your disposal, including relationships, filters, ordering, and limits.

Reads and writes within a mutator are transactional, meaning that the datastore is guaranteed to not change while your mutator is running. And if the mutator throws, the entire mutation is rolled back.

### Invoking Client Mutators

Once you have registered your client mutators, you can call them from your client-side application:

```ts
zero.mutate.issue.update({
  id: 'issue-123',
  title: 'New title',
});
```

Mutations execute instantly on the client, but it is sometimes useful to know when the server has applied the mutation (or experienced an error doing so).

You can get the server result of a mutation with the `server` property of a mutator's return value:

```ts
const serverResult = await zero.mutate.issue.update({
  id: 'issue-123',
  title: 'New title',
}).server;

if (server.error) {
  console.error("Server mutation went boom", server.error);
} else {
  console.log("Server mutation complete");
}
```

<Note heading="Returning data from mutators">
  You will soon be able to use `server.data` to return data from mutators in the success case. [Let us know](https://discord.rocicorp.dev/) if you need this soon.
</Note>

### Setting Up the Server

You will need a server somewhere you can run an endpoint on. This is typically a serverless function on a platform like Vercel or AWS but can really be anything.

The URL of the endpoint can be anything. You control it with the [push-url](./zero-cache-config#push-url) option to `zero-cache`.

The push endpoint receives a `PushRequest` as input describing one or more mutations to apply to the backend, and must return a `PushResponse` describing the results of those mutations.

If you are implementing your server in TypeScript, you can use the `PushProcessor` class to trivially implement this endpoint. Hereâ€™s an example in a [Hono](https://hono.dev/) app:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { handle } from "hono/vercel";
import { connectionProvider, PushProcessor } from "@rocicorp/zero/pg";
import postgres from "postgres";
import { schema } from "../shared/schema";
import { createMutators } from "../shared/mutators";

// PushProcessor is provided by Zero to encapsulate a standard
// implementation of the push protocol.
const processor = new PushProcessor(
  schema,
  connectionProvider(postgres(process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB as string))
);

export const app = new Hono().basePath("/api");

app.post("/push", async (c) => {
  const result = await processor.process(
    createMutators(),
    c.req.query(),
    await c.req.json()
  );
  return await c.json(result);
});

export default handle(app);
```

The `connectionProvider` argument allows `PushProcessor` to create a connection and run transactions against your database. We provide an implementation for the excellent [`postgres.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres) library, but you can [implement an adapter](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/bb9ba1bde0b11689ed3be8814c2acabb145b951b/packages/zql/src/mutate/custom.ts#L67) for a different Postgres library if you prefer.

To reuse the client mutators exactly as-is on the server just pass the result of the same `createMutators` function to `PushProcessor`.

### Server-Specific Code

To implement server-specific code, just run different mutators in your push endpoint!

An approach we like is to create a separate `server-mutators.ts` file that wraps the client mutators:

```ts
// server-mutators.ts
import { CustomMutatorDefs } from "@rocicorp/zero";
import { schema } from "./schema";

export function createMutators(clientMutators: CustomMutatorDefs<typeof schema>) {
  return {
    // Reuse all client mutators except the ones in `issue`
    ...clientMutators

    issue: {
      // Reuse all issue mutators except `update`
      ...clientMutators.issue,

      update: async (tx, {id, title}: { id: string; title: string }) => {
        // Call the shared mutator first
        await clientMutators.issue.update(tx, args);

        // Record a history of this operation happening in an audit
        // log table.
        await tx.mutate.auditLog.insert({
          // Assuming you have an audit log table with fields for
          // `issueId`, `action`, and `timestamp`.
          issueId: args.id,
          action: 'update-title',
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        });
      },
    }
  } as const satisfies CustomMutatorDefs<typeof schema>;
}
```

For simple things, we also expose a `location` field on the transaction object that you can use to branch your code:

```ts
myMutator: (tx) => {
  if (tx.location === 'client') {
    // Client-side code
  } else {
    // Server-side code
  }
},
```

### Permissions

Because custom mutators are just arbitrary TypeScript functions, there is no need for a special permissions system. Therefore, you won't use Zero's [write permissions](./permissions) when you use custom mutators.

<Note emoji="ðŸ’¡" heading="You do still need *read* permissions">
  When using custom mutators you will have no [`insert`](permissions#insert-permissions), [`update`](permissions#update-permissions), or [`delete`](permissions#delete-permissions) permissions. You will still have [`select`](permissions#select-permissions) permissions, however.

  We hope to build [custom queries](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3453) next â€“ a read analog to custom mutators. If we succeed, Zero's permission system will go away completely ðŸ¤¯.
</Note>

In order to do permission checks, you'll need to know what user is making the request. You can pass this information to your mutators by adding a `AuthData` parameter to the `createMutators` function:

```ts
type AuthData = {
  sub: string;
}

export function createMutators(authData: AuthData|undefined) {
  return {
    issue: {
      launchMissiles: async (tx, args: { target: string }) => {
        if (!authData) {
          throw new Error('Users must be logged in to launch missiles');
        }

        const hasPermission = await tx.query.user
          .where('id', authData.sub)
          .whereExists('permissions',
              q => q.where('name', 'launch-missiles'))
          .one().run();
        if (!hasPermission) {
          throw new Error(
            'User does not have permission to launch missiles');
        }
      },
    }
  } as const satisfies CustomMutatorDefs<typeof schema>;
}
```

The `AuthData` parameter can be any data required for authorization, but is typically just the decoded JWT:

```ts
// app.tsx
const zero = new Zero({
  schema,
  auth: encodedJWT,
  mutators: createMutators(decodedJWT),
});

// hono-server.ts
const processor = new PushProcessor(
  schema,
  connectionProvider(
    postgres(process.env.ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB as string))
);
processor.process(
  createMutators(decodedJWT), c.req.query(), await c.req.json());
```

### Dropping Down to Raw SQL

On the server, you can use raw SQL in addition or instead of ZQL. This is useful for complex queries, or for using Postgres features that Zero doesn't support yet:

```ts
async function markAllAsRead(tx: Transaction, {userId: string}) {
  await tx.dbTransaction.query(`
    UPDATE notification
    SET read = true
    WHERE user_id = $1
  `, [userId]);
}
```

### Notifications and Async Work

It is bad practice to hold open database transactions while talking over the network, for example to send notifications. Instead, you should let the db transaction commit and do the work asynchronously.

There is no specific support for this in custom mutators, but since mutators are just code, itâ€™s easy to do:

```ts
// server-mutators.ts
export function createMutators(authData: AuthData,
    asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>>) {
  return {
    issue: {
      update: async (tx,
          {id, title}: { id: string; title: string }) => {
        await tx.mutate.issue.update({id, title});

        asyncTasks.push(async () => {
          await sendEmailToSubscribers(args.id);
        });
      },
    }
  } as const satisfies CustomMutatorDefs<typeof schema>;
}
```

Then in your push handler:

```ts
app.post("/push", async (c) => {
  const asyncTasks: Array<() => Promise<void>> = [];
  const result = await processor.process(
    createMutators(authData, asyncTasks),
    c.req.query(),
    await c.req.json()
  );

  await Promise.all(asyncTasks.map(task => task()));
  return await c.json(result);
});
```

### Custom Database Connections

You can implement an adapter to a different Postgres library, or even a different database entirely.

To do so, provide a `connectionProvider` to `PushProcessor` that returns a different [`DBConnection`](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/1a3741fbdad6dbdd56aa1f48cc2cc83938a61b16/packages/zql/src/mutate/custom.ts#L67) implementation. For an example implementation, [see the `postgres` implementation](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/1a3741fbdad6dbdd56aa1f48cc2cc83938a61b16/packages/zero-pg/src/postgres-connection.ts#L4).

### Custom Push Implementation

You can manually implement the push protocol in any programming language.

This will be documented in the future, but you can refer to the [PushProcessor](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/1a3741fbdad6dbdd56aa1f48cc2cc83938a61b16/packages/zero-pg/src/web.ts#L33) source code for an example for now.
